<p>To get started programming IBCM programs, there are two documents
(both listed on the documentation section of
the <a href="index.html">main page</a>):
the <a href="ibcm-poo.pdf">IBCM Principles of Operation</a> describes
the IBCM language and all of the 16 available instructions, and
the <a href="ibcm-code-eg.pdf">IBCM code examples</a> lists, and
explains, two programs that have been written in IBCM.  Those programs
can be downloaded directly <a href="summation.ibcm">here</a>
and <a href="array-summation.ibcm">here</a>.</p>

<p>The IBCM is not a real computer, of course. Nonetheless, one can
run programs written for it. The trick is that we have written a
PHP/Javascript "simulator", a program that makes another computer
behave more-or-less like the IBCM 2.2.  The IBCM 2.2 simulator will
execute all the instructions of the machine and show the contents of
memory locations and the accumulator as it executes.</p>

<p>To load a file, use the Browse button at the top of the
<a href="simulator.php">simulator page</a>.  Find the IBCM file,
and click on the "Load" button.  The format of your program file is
very rigid -- the first four characters of each line are interpreted
as a hexadecimal number. The number on the first line is loaded into
location zero, the next into location one and so on. Characters after
the first four on each line are ignored, so you should use them to
comment the code.  An invalid file will either not load up at all, or
will load up gibberish.</p>

<p>The left side of the simulator lists all the memory locations
(using the hexadecimal address), the value in memory (if any), and the
PC (program counter) value.  Note that any blank value field is
interpreted as'0000', as per the IBCM specification.  The simulator
leaves uninitialized values blank to increase readability.</p>

<p>The value column consists of a series of text boxes, which allow
you to directly edit the values in memory.  The simulator will read
the current memory location from the appropriate textbox when
executing an instruction.  You can undo any edits by using the Revert
button, described below.  The IBCM simulator does not check to ensure
that your entered values are valid -- it is up to the user to do this.
Note that all hexadecimal values must be 4 digits (i.e. '0000', not
'0'), or else the simulator will not work correctly.  <strong>Be sure
to read the section about crashing browsers and losing your work,
below.</strong>  There is no way to save your edited work -- you will
need to copy the changes by hand.  This is party due to a browser
limitation, and partly due to the fact that memory editing is meant to
be a debugging tool, not a means to write entire IBCM programs from
scratch.</p>

<p>The 'PC' column lists the current value of the program counter.  It
can have three values.  Normally, it will have a left pointing arrow
('&lt;-'), which indicates the <i>next</i> instruction that will be
executed.  If the simulator is waiting for input, it will have a
capital 'I' (for Input) next to the input instruction that is
currently awaiting a value.  Lastly, if the program has halted, then a
capital 'H' (for Halt) will be next to the halt instruction that was
executed.</p>

<p>On the right side, the values of the accumulator and program
counter are listed, both in hexadecimal notation.  The PC field will
also list, next to the hexadecimal address, if the simulator is
awaiting input or is halted.  The Input box is used to read in user
input when a program requests it.  When the simulator is waiting for
input, it will flash the 'Input' text.  In addition, the simulator
will specify which type of input is being requested: 'hex' or 'asc'
for hexadecimal or ASCII input, respectively.  Note that for entering
a hexadecimal value, you do not need to enter all 4 digits: i.e., you
can enter '12' instead of '0012'.  This is distinctly different that
editing memory locations (you have to enter all 4 digits for those).
If you enter multiple characters for ASCII input, it will only read in
the first one.</p>

<p>Below this are four buttons.  Two control execution: Run, which
will start a program executing, and Step, which will execute a single
instruction.  Note that Run will execute until either a halt command
is reached, or until an input command is reached.  The other two
buttons control the resetting of the IBCM program.  The Reset button
will reset the PC and accumulator, in effect allowing the program to
run again.  It will not, however, modify any memory locations.  The
Revert button will do what a Reset does, but will also reload the
memory locations to what they were when the file was last loaded (it
does not load the file from disk again).  Thus, if you have edited any
of the memory locations (or the IBCM program has modified them), then
those changes will be erased on a Revert, but not on a Reset.  Note
that a Revert will not modify memory addresses outside the range that
was loaded (i.e. any 'blank' values).</p>

<p>Any output is displayed in the text area below these buttons.  Each
output command prints the value (hexadecimal or ASCII character) on a
separate line.</p>

<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice a slight delay when loading the simulator page.
  This is due to the fact that a number of scripts are run when the
  page loads (to initialize the memory table of 4096 elements, for
  example), and this takes a bit of time.  How long this takes is
  determined by how fast a computer it is running on (the scripts are
  run on the client side).<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Upon entering input, hitting Enter is considered the same as
 hitting the Run button again.  If you only want to execute a single
 instruction after an input, you  must click on the Step button.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>The simulator does minimal error checking with the input from the
 keyboard during program execution -- it is the user's responsibility
 to ensure that the input is properly formatted.  The only error
 checking that is done is to ensure that a non-empty string was
 entered (if it was, then the simulator waits for more input).<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Because of the limitations of threads running in web browsers,
 there is no way to terminate a program that is stuck in an infinite
 (or very long) loop -- the browser will not allow a polling
 (checking) to see if a Stop button was pressed, for example.  Some
 browsers will pause the script after a minute (or so) of execution,
 and ask if the user wants to continue.  Alternatively, you can close
 the web browser and restart. <strong>Note that this means if you have
 edited any of the memory locations, and your browser hangs or is
 restarted, you will lose any and all changes you have made to the
 memory locations!</strong><br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>The <a href="simulator.php">simulator page</a> is a PHP script,
which means that it will not work if you are viewing it as a local
file (if the beginning of your URL is &quot;file://&quot; instead of
&quot;http://&quot;), or if the web server hosting this page does not
have PHP installed (this includes UVa's Collab web server).<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Browser compatability: It has been tested in Internet Explorer
under Windows XP, Safari under Mac OS X, and <a
href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> under Windows
XP, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu Linux.  Note that the changing of the values
as the simulation is run (the PC, memory values, etc.) only works
under Firefox.  The other browsers will have the same end state after
the program is run, but will not animate the execution of the IBCM
program when 'Run' is pressed (the 'Step' command will still animate
each step).<br />&nbsp;</li>
