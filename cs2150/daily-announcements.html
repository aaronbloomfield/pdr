## Lecture 15: Friday, October 2nd, 2015
- Office hours are listed in the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1ea0dfillqvhlop8d7t0m8afuo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America/New_York); use the [office hours queue](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/queue.php)
  - Due to the midterm exam and fall break, we will not have office hours for the next week (or week and a half)
- [Midterm 1](../exams/exam1-f15.pdf)!
  - The grading system broke, so we didn't get it graded last night :-(
  - We are aiming to grade it *next* Thursday
  - There was that ifdef/ifndef typo (the version in the repo has this typo fixed)
  - We will go over it *next* Friday in lecture
- Labs and grading
  - Grades through [Lab 3](../labs/lab03/index.html) have been returned
  - [Lab 4](../labs/lab04/index.html) (numbers) is out to be graded, but that may not be back for a while due to gradnig of the exam and fall break
  - As next week is fall break, there is no lab; however, [Lab 5](../labs/lab05/index.html) (trees) and [Tutorial 5](../tutorials/05-make/index.html) (make) are ready in the repo
- [Lectures are posted online](index.html) in a Flash movie format
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/415219f8-1a72-4ade-a753-b37ec6aecb61/page/37b584bf-c5a5-41e1-bda7-1f2fcbec258e)!  It's through Collab.  It's pretty lonely, and looking for friends.
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- Today we will continue with [trees](../slides/05-trees.html#/), which will take us through most (or all) of next week
  - I will be out of town on Wednesday, and Mark Floryan will be convering lecture

## Midterm procedure
- This is the procedure for both midterms this semester
- It is taken during your normal lab section
- The first rule of 2150 midterm is that you don't speak about 2150 midterm
  - (Translation: it is an honor violation to speak about it to somebody who has not taken it yet)
- You have to fill out the [bubble footer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/images/exam-footer.jpg) at the bottom of the first page of the exam
  - And put your name and UVa userid at the top of each page
  - And sign the honor pledge
- ~~There will be a review session, likely the evening of the Sunday prior~~
- We hope to have it graded later that week (Thursday evening is our grading party)
  - Its completion will generate my second (of five!) course-wide emails
- There will not be office hours the Wednesday and Thursday of a midterm week
- Obviously, no lab is released at the end of the week prior to the midterm
  - But one will be released the week *of* a midterm for the following week
- Many questions will have a "word limit"...

## Grades and regrades
- Our aim is to return the lab grades "one week" later
  - That means by Monday a week and 3 days after the post-lab is due (late deadline is on a Saturday)
  - We may not always manage this...
- All grading guidelines are posted in the [Collab wiki](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/415219f8-1a72-4ade-a753-b37ec6aecb61/page/cf081a8e-49ca-4fd5-8f6b-5399dafb7268) (*not* in the github repo!)
- You have 10 days, from when it was returned, to submit a regrade
  - Fill them out via the [regrades tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=regrades.php)
- Regrades are ONLY if we did not properly follow the grading guidelines in your homework
  - They are not an opportunity to make up the work!
  - Nor are they an opportunity to dispute the grading guidelines (that should be done in person)
- Regrades will not be handled in a timely fashion!
  - It's the lowest priority, and they often wait until the end of the semester
  - You can see your submitted regrade status via the [regrades tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=regrades.php)
  - You will receive an email when it is handled
