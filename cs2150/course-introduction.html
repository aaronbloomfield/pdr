## Collab
- I try to avoid it at all costs.  But I'll use it for:
  - Large file downloads (VirtualBox image, lecture recordings)
  - The email list and anonymous feedback
  - The wiki, but only for very few things
- Most everything else is external to Collab
  - Course tools: [support requests](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=support.php), 
    [lab submission](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=submit.php), 
    [regrades](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=regrades.php), 
    [gradebook](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=gradebook.php), 
    [lab extensions](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=labextension.php), and the [office hours queue](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=queue.php)
  - Slides, labs, and tutorials are in the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr) (more on this in a bit)
- We'll see a tour of the Collab tools, and the github repo, in the next lecture
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Contacting Us

## Contacting Us
![Who to contact](images/introduction/contacting-flowchart-small.png)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Please don't email me
- It's not because I'm being a jerk (really!)
- Email is not an efficeint form of communication with me
  - I get too bogged down in way too many emails, and then I can't respond in a reasonable amount of time, which is unfair to you
- You can always fill out a [support request](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=support.php) -- that's what they are there for
- There are other ways to get in touch with me...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How to get in contact with me
- Swing by my office hours
- ~~See me right after class to either discuss the issue (if it's quick) or arrange a time to meet (if it's not)~~
  - I teach another class 10 minutes after this, and very far away, so I have to leave *right* when class ends
  - That course will (shortly) become M/W only, so Fridays will start working for this
- Swing by my office when I'm in to likewise either discuss the issue (if it's quick) or arrange a time to meet
- Submit a support request to arrange a time to meet (include your availability)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Swinging by my office
- If you have a concern, feel free to swing by my office (Rice 403); some caveats:
  - If it is something that can be handled by a support request, I'll ask you to do that
  - Likewise if the TA office hours can handle it, I may direct you to them
  - If I'm busy, I'll try to find a time that we can meet later
- This needs to be used only when necessary -- as there are about 250 students in this course, I cannot handle everybody swinging by my office whenever they want...
- Mondays and Wednesdays will be the best days to find me there
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Contacting You
- Announcements are posted to the course twitter feed: [@UVaCS2150](https://twitter.com/@UVaCS2150)
  - In an effort to keep it uncluttered (so that people can find what they are looking for), I will generally not respond to individual tweets from that account
- Class Email
  - I use this sparingly -- I expect to send 5 (five!) emails this entire semester, unless something goes very wrong
    - And one of those five has already been sent...
- Things in this course happen on a very structured schedule, so there will be no surprises as to when things happen
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meetings
- Lectures: MWF 11:00-11:50 in Gilmer 130
  - Lectures will be recorded, and posted on Collab
- Lab meetings: 1 per week
  - Tues 9:15 am - 10:50 am, 12:15 pm - 1:50 pm, 2:00 pm - 3:35 pm, 3:50 pm - 5:25 pm, 5:30 pm - 7:05 pm, or 7:30 pm - 9:05 pm
  - You cannot attend another lab section without prior permission
    - And due to lab size, that generally cannot be granted
- Office hours, if you choose to attend them
	  </script></section>

<!--
	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Spring 2014 Registration Issues
- We are aware that there are about 40 people on the waitlist
- The current plan is to limit the existing labs to 40 people each, and open up more lab section(s)
- If that fails, then note that we cannot, for any reason, allow the registration for a given lab section to go above 44 students
  - There are not enough computers, and you cannot use your own computer
  - Which means we may have very little room for registration
  - Priority would go to ALREADY declared computing majors
- I hope to know more soon
  - Once I do know more, it will be posted on the Twitter feed
  - And announced in class on Wednesday
	  </script></section>
-->

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Expectations
- Prerequisites: (CS 2110 or CS 2220) and CS 2102, all with a C- or above
- You understand basic programming (CS I & II):
  - Can write a program longer than a screen-full
  - Understand references, classes, objects, templates (generics)
  - Familiar with common control structures, procedures, recursive definitions
- You remember some things from CS 2102 (or will learn/refresh your understanding when you need them):
  - Arithmetic, logarithms, sets, graphs
  - Proof techniques (induction, contradiction)
  - This material may be used in the context of a test question
	  </script></section>
	  
	  <section id="cs2102" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CS 2102 as a co-req
- If you have not already taken CS 2102 previously, you may take it this semester
- However, by doing so, you understand and agree that any 2102 material that ends up on the exam is your bad luck
- That's why it's listed as a pre-req!
- For the current semester, there may still be some spots available in CS 2102
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Labs / HWs
- Labs are much bigger in this course, and essentially are the homeworks
- Labs will generally be made available on Thursday by noon, and due throughout the following week
  - Pre-lab to be done BEFORE showing up to Tuesday's lab section: all are due at the same time on Tuesday (that time is the time the first lab section starts)
    - Often includes a tutorial
  - In-lab to be done IN lab section (due at the end of your lab section)
  - Post-lab to be done AFTER lab section (due Friday morning before the *first* lecture)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## More on Labs
- Labs begin *next* week
- Labs are posted Thursdays, generally by noon
- There are late policies for the labs -- these are discussed in the first lab
- Lab attendance is required!
  - And you can't change sections without prior permission, as we don't have the computers or TAs to support this
	  </script></section>

	  <section id="registration" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Fall 2015 registration issues
- We cannot have more than 45 people registered for a given lab due to fire marshal limits
  - And those limits can't be changed (I've asked)
- Six labs exist, although one of them may not be allowed to be filled to capacity (departmental decision, not mine)
- If you are *not* currently enrolled in the course (this includes those on the wait list):
  - Please fill out the survey at http://tinyurl.com/pqyckwd
  - You must do this EVEN IF you did it before (all responses were intentionally cleared out on August 19th)
  - Note the chances of you getting into a lab that is not the 9:15 lab are essentially zero
  - I will handle this over the weekend of August 29/30; lab extensions will be granted if you miss the first lab due dates due to a late registration
- I do not yet know if I can offer any more people spots in the course (departmental policy), but I will do my best...
	  </script></section>

	  <section id="labswaps" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lab Swaps
- You are welcome to swap labs with somebody else, or switch into a lab that has free spots
  - Exception: I may not be allowed to fill up the 9:15 lab (departmental policy)
- To switch to an open lab, do a lab section swap in SIS
  - If you attempt to drop and then re-add the course, you will go to the END of the waitlist, and then you will not be allowed back into the course!
  - And make sure there is room in the destination lab before you try this!!!
- To swap with somebody:
  - Post on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class) to find somebody to switch with
    - If you are reading this before the semester starts, then wait until the first day of class to post...
  - Once you have found somebody, ask Mary Lane (in Thorton A122) to swap the two of you
- Please understand that I do not have the ability to do any of these actions myself
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lab due times
- All the labs have a [specified due time](labduedates.html), as described in lab 1, and mentioned previously
  - The submission server has it's clock set to the US Navy atomic clock
- If the lab is late for ANY reason, then you will receive the late penalty.  Thus, you should take this into account and not wait until the last minute to try to submit.  These reasons include:
  - Your Internet being down
  - Your computer being slow
  - UVa's Internet being down
  - Your younger sibling messing up your submission
  - Your dog eating your homework
  - You missing the deadline by 1 minute, but pleeeaaaassseeeee!!!!!111oneoneONEONE
- The ONLY exception is if any of the following are down: the submission server itself or the CS department's network (that allows the server to be accessed)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## In-lab submission
- In-labs ***MUST*** be (initially) done from <font color='#ff0000'>an Olsson 001 computer</font>, or else you will receive zero credit!
  - This means either submitting the assignment, or submitting a lab extension, from that computer
  - If you submit a lab extension, then you can complete it from another computer, such as your personal one
  - Likewise, if you submit your assignment during lab, you can revise it (up until the due date/time) from another computer

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Piazza
- [Piazza](https://piazza.com) is a useful newsgroup-like tool for collegiate courses
  - Students post questions, and other students or instructors can post answers
- When you log in (via Collab) for the first time, an account is created for you
  - If the e-mail settings default to "send annoying emails all the time", you can easily change this
    - In Piazza, in the upper-right, click on the gear/settings icon, select "Account/Email Settings", and then select "Edit Email Notifications" under "Class & Email Settings"
- Piazza posts are generally answered by the TAs and other students
	  </script></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Accounts
- Lab Accounts (for Olsson 001 or Rice 340)
  - There are two of these: one for Linux, one for Windows; we do not expect to use the Windows account
  - You will receive two email about this, one for each account
- Your [Collab](http://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal) account, which you should already have
- Your [Piazza](https://piazza.com) account, which will be created when you log into Piazza via Collab
- You do *NOT* need a github account for this course (more on this shortly)
  - But feel free to create one!  It will be used heavily in successive courses.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unix
This class will program exclusively in a Unix environment.  There are a number of options to do so (listed from easy to hard):

- Run VirtualBox (it's free) and use the course Linux image
  - This is recommended; there will be extensive directions
  - You <font color='#ff0000'>MUST USE VIRTUALBOX VERSION 4.3</font>
    - Version 5.0 and above do NOT work properly!
- Program in Linux in Olsson 001 (when a lab is not in session); you can get a key for a $5 deposit
- Mac users can use a terminal window, as Mac OS X is based on Unix -- but you can't use an IDE!
  - Note that some things (such as doxygen and some x86 features) are not compatible!
- Install a Unix OS (Linux, etc.) on your home machine
  - Backup everything first!!!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unix honor pledge

In order to take this class, you must agree to sign an honor pledge stating that you will not use any MS Windows development environment (including Visual Studio) for any work for this class.  If you do, it will be an honor violation, and you will receive an automatic F for the course.  
&nbsp;  
Furthermore, you cannot use any IDE (Xcode, Eclipse, Netbeans, etc. Visual Studio) on any OS for the code development in this course  
&nbsp;  
(the reason for this is to teach you Unix, not a vendetta against IDEs)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Compiler usage
- We are NOT using gcc/g++ this semester
  - This is a change from previous semesters
- Instead we are using clang++ (from LLVM)
  - If you don't know what this means, you can safely ignore it
  - But if you are familiar with gcc/g++, please don't use it, as clang has MUCH better error messages
- (Note that we will use gcc/g++ for the two x86 labs, but more on that later)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Textbooks
- There are none for this course
  - The books that exist are way too expensive and not all that good
- Instead, we will have optional [online readings](../docs/readings.html) for those who would like to read about the course material as well
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course materials
- Most of the course materials can be found online; more on this shortly
- These slides are written using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/), a HTML-based presentation system
  - The source for the slides is in the github repo (more on this shortly)
- Lecture recordings are stored in Collab (in the Resources/lectures directory), and are linked to via the [main CS 2150 page](index.html) ([md](index.md))
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Printing the slides
- To export to a PDF (and thus to print), you must use Google Chrome; see [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#pdf-export) for details on how to print
  - Don't worry about step 1 -- just add "?print-pdf" to the end of the URL: [course-introduction.html?print-pdf](course-introduction.html?print-pdf)
    - Or click on the printer icon (<a href="course-introduction.html?print-pdf"><img class="print" width="20" src="../slides/images/print-icon.png" style="vertical-align:middle"></a> ) on the title slide
  - This prints one slide per page
- Use a program to print 6 slides per page
  - I use [evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince/Downloads), but Acrobat can likely do this as well
  - In evince, set pages per side to 6, and scaling to 97%
- Note that the slides are not in a linear format, so printing may cause issues; you can always view the slides online
  - Click 'o' to see the non-linear layout of the slides; click 'o' or Escape to return
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## git repository
- git is a revision control system which is used to track changes to "stuff" (source code, slide sets, etc.)
  - It keeps them in "repositories" or "repos"
  - It also easily allows group work on a single code base, although we won't see that in this course
- Most of the course materials can be found online at http://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr
  - The contents of that repo can be viewed online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr
  - As mentioned previously, a few things are still in Collab
  - And the stuff specific to you (grades, submissions, etc.) are through the [set of online tools](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Not using git
- If you choose not to use git, then every time you want to download any updates to the course materials, you will have to go to http://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr, re-download the *entire* .zip file, delete the old directory, and uncompress the newly downloaded file
  - As I am going to be updating the content in the repository throughout the semester, this will very quickly become a real pain to deal with
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Using git, part 1
- git is installed on the VirtualBox image (more on VirtualBox shortly)
- To use git, enter the following command only once (no github account needed!):
```
git clone https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr.git
```
  - This will create a 'pdr' directory that contains everything from the repo: the slides, the labs, the tutorials, etc.
  - Note that much of the content of this repository will be updated throughout the semester
  - This was already done on the provided VirtualBox image
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Using git, part 2
- To get the latest version, just change into that directory via the command line ("`cd pdr`"), and enter:
```
git pull
```
- That's it!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A warning about the git repo
- You will see future assignments (labs, mostly) in the git repo
- Feel free to look at these, but...
- I will be making many changes up until the time I officially "release" them to the class
  - This "official release" is as of the date of posting of the lab availability on the Twitter feed: [@UVaCS2150](https://twitter.com/@UVaCS2150)
  - This will be the Wednesday or Thursday the week before they are due
- If you start them early, then it is **YOUR** responsibility to figure out what changes have been made to the assignment between when you started it and when I finalized it
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course syllabus
- It is availabe in the github repo; you can click [here](../cs2150/syllabus.html) to view it
- It contains all the information covered so far, plus some more stuffs
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Learning your names...
I am determined to learn each of your (first) names  
&nbsp;  
So if you raise your hand in lecture, and I don't call on you by name, you have to say your first name before your question  
&nbsp;  
Don't be offended if it takes me a while -- there are about 250 of you...

# Honor Policy
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Class Honor Policy
The University of Virginia Honor Policy in effect.  In addition to the normal rules, we have additional rules (full details in the [course syllabus](syllabus.html)):

1. You may not look at the code of another student (past or present) for ANY reason
2. You may not try to hack my submission system
3. You may not discuss the midterm details to someone who has not already taken it
4. You may not release your source code online (including in a public github repo)
5. You may not use a computer to generate your submitted *assembly* code unless otherwise allowed
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Class Honor Policy
Any honor violation or cheating will be referred to the honor committee, and will result in <strong class="red">immediate failure</strong> for the course  
&nbsp;  
I have done this before, and I will do it again.  Please don't test me on this.  
&nbsp;  
We will see the cheat-checking program later this semester, as we will have learned enough theory to understand how it works
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Do these count as honor violations?
- Copying somebody's code completely, even if they've taken the course a year ago
- http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/35616/
- A student who, upon taking the class a second time, claimed s/he had already submitted the assignment before (being in the class previously), and thus was allowed to copy the assignment from somebody else
- Taking a 45 minute bathroom break during the final exam to look up the answews
- Looking up the answers on your cell phone during an exam.
<p class="fragment">The answer to all of these is yes, by the way.  And they have all happened in my courses.</p>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Grading Criteria
- 40% Labs (there will be 11 labs)
- 30% Midterms, during lab and in lab classroom
  - Midterm 1: Tuesday, September 29th; midterm 2: Tuesday, November 10th
- 25% Final Exam
  - Friday, December 11th from 9:00 am to noon in Gilmer 130 (the lecture classroom)

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Final exam
- Because there are two lecture periods, this class has a common exam time: Saturday, May 3rd, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.
  - You may NOT take it early for any reason
  - You may NOT take the exam at a different time because you have a busy final exam schedule
- Other classes that also have an exam then:
  - APMA 3110
  - ECON 2020 (sections 100 and 200 only)
- You must let me know by the end of January if you have a conflict (submit a [support request](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=support.php))
  - If you don't let us know by then, then you will have to take it at the common time

## Compilation
- You will receive <strong class="red">zero credit</strong> for code that does not compile
  - Unless my compiler breaks, there will be absolutely NO exceptions to this rule, so please don't even ask
  - This is an advanced programming class, and under no circumstances should you submit code that does not compile
- The submission system will compile the code when you submit it
  - But that means you have to actually watch the result of your submission (it takes all of 5 seconds)
  - We have a [guide](../docs/compilation.html) as to how to work through compilation errors, and what to do if you can't get it to compile

# Course Goals
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course Goals
1. Levels of abstraction
2. Implementing data structures
3. Time and space complexity analysis
4. Basic program execution model (hw/sw)
5. Assembly language programming
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course Goal 1
Understand program representation from high-level programming language to machine level representation
![Levels of abstraction](images/introduction/levels-of-abstraction.png)
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course Goal 2
Be able to implement basic and advanced data structures in C++  
&nbsp;

- linked lists
- stacks
- queues
- hash tables
- heaps
- trees
- etc.
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why do we care about data structures?
- One answer (of many): time
- Consider a program that does the following:
  - Creates 5 list-like data structures
  - Adds 50,000 elements (even integers from 0-100,000)
  - Searches for 25,000 elements (integers from 0-25,000)
  - Deletes 10,000 elements (integers from 0-10,000)
- And records the time each data structure takes for these operations
  - See [DataStructureComparison.java](code/introduction/DataStructureComparison.java.html) ([src](code/introduction/DataStructureComparison.java))
- What are the results?

## The results
From a Pentium 3.0 Ghz PC with enough memory

| Data structure | Running time | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Vector         | 17.311 sec   | Rarely used |
| ArrayList      | 17.281 sec   | Likely most common |
| LinkedList     | 24.255 sec   | Slowest |
| HashSet        | 0.122 sec    | Very fast |
| TreeSet        | 0.119 sec    | Fastest |

&nbsp;  
<p class="fragment">Difference between a ArrayList and TreeSet: a factor of ~150</p>
<p class="fragment">Difference between a LinkedList and TreeSet: a factor of ~200</p>

## Feedback from previous semesters
You can view my entire course evals on [my personal website](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/) (including from last semester); some examples:

- "This has been the most informative / difficult CS course I've taken so far, but definitely worth it"
- "This course was incredibly challenging, especially for me having not programmed in over a year -- This class changed my entire perspective on computer science, and is giving me an awesome foundation for the rest of my computer science education."
- "Course was difficult, however I learned a lot."
- (and a bunch of complaints about the amount of work, blah, blah, blah)
