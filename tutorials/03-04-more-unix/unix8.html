<h1>UNIX Tutorial Eight </h1>
<h2>8.1 UNIX Variables</h2>
<p>Variables are a way of passing information from the shell to programs when 
  you run them. Programs look &quot;in the environment&quot; for particular variables 
  and if they are found will use the values stored. Some are set by the system, 
  others by you, yet others by the shell, or any program that loads another program. 
</p>
<p>Standard UNIX variables are split into two categories, environment variables 
  and shell variables. In broad terms, shell variables apply only to the current 
  instance of the shell and are used to set short-term working conditions; environment 
  variables have a farther reaching significance, and those set at login are valid 
  for the duration of the session. By convention, environment variables have UPPER 
  CASE and shell variables have lower case names. </p>

<h2>8.2 Environment Variables</h2>
<p>An example of an environment variable is the OSTYPE variable. The value of 
  this is the current operating system you are using. Type </p>
<p class="command">% echo $OSTYPE </p>
<p>More examples of environment variables are </p>
<ul>
  <li> USER (your login name)</li>
  <li> HOME (the path name of your home directory)</li>
  <li> HOST (the name of the computer you are using)</li>
  <li> ARCH (the architecture of the computers processor)</li>
  <li> DISPLAY (the name of the computer screen to display X windows)</li>
  <li> PRINTER (the default printer to send print jobs)</li>
  <li> PATH (the directories the shell should search to find a command)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finding out the current values of these variables.</h3>

<p>ENVIRONMENT variables are set using the <samp>setenv</samp> command, displayed 
  using the <samp>printenv</samp> or <samp>env</samp> commands, and unset using 
  the <samp>unsetenv</samp> command. </p>
<p>To show all values of these variables, type</p>
<p class="command">% printenv | less</p>
<h2>8.3 Shell Variables</h2>
<p>An example of a shell variable is the history variable. The value of this is 
  how many shell commands to save, allow the user to scroll back through all the 
  commands they have previously entered. Type</p>
<p class="command">% echo $history</p>
<p>More examples of shell variables are </p>
<ul>
  <li>cwd (your current working directory)
  </li>
  <li> home (the path name of your home directory)
  </li>
  <li> path (the directories the shell should search to find a command)
  </li>
  <li> prompt (the text string used to prompt for interactive commands shell your 
    login shell)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Finding out the current values of these variables.</h3>

<p>SHELL variables are both set and displayed using the <samp>set</samp> command. 
  They can be unset by using the <samp>unset</samp> command. </p>
<p>To show all values of these variables, type</p>
<p class="command">% set | less</p>

<h3>So what is the difference between PATH and path ?</h3>
<p>In general, environment and shell variables that have the same name (apart 
  from the case) are distinct and independent, except for possibly having the 
  same initial values. There are, however, exceptions. </p>
<p>Each time the shell variables home, user and term are changed, the corresponding 
  environment variables HOME, USER and TERM receive the same values. However, 
  altering the environment variables has no effect on the corresponding shell 
  variables. </p>
<p>PATH and path specify directories to search for commands and programs. Both 
  variables always represent the same directory list, and altering either automatically 
  causes the other to be changed. </p>
<h2>8.4 Using and setting variables</h2>
<p>Each time you login to a UNIX host, the system looks in your home directory 
  for initialisation files. Information in these files is used to set up your 
  working environment. The C and TC shells uses two files called .login and .cshrc 
  (note that both file names begin with a dot).</p>
<p>At login the C shell first reads <strong>.cshrc</strong> followed by <strong>.login</strong></p>
<p><strong>.login</strong> is to set conditions which will apply to the whole 
  session and to perform actions that are relevant only at login. </p>
<p><strong>.cshrc</strong> is used to set conditions and perform actions specific 
  to the shell and to each invocation of it.</p>
<p>The guidelines are to set ENVIRONMENT variables in the <strong>.login</strong> 
  file and SHELL variables in the <strong>.cshrc</strong> file. </p>
<p class="warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> NEVER put commands that run graphical 
  displays (e.g. a web browser) in your .cshrc or .login file. </p>
<h2>8.5 Setting shell variables in the .cshrc file</h2>
<p>For example, to change the number of shell commands saved in the history list, 
  you need to set the shell variable history. It is set to 100 by default, but 
  you can increase this if you wish.</p>
<p class="command">% set history = 200</p>
<p>Check this has worked by typing</p>
<p class="command">% echo $history</p>
<p>However, this has only set the variable for the lifetime of the current shell. 
  If you open a new xterm window, it will only have the default history value 
  set. To PERMANENTLY set the value of history, you will need to add the set command 
  to the .cshrc file.</p>
<p>First open the <strong>.cshrc</strong> file in a text editor. An easy, user-friendly 
  editor to use is nedit.</p>
<p class="command">% nedit ~/.cshrc</p>
<p>Add the following line AFTER the list of other commands.</p>
<p class="sourcecode"> set history = 200</p>
<p>Save the file and force the shell to reread its .cshrc file buy using the shell 
  source command.</p>
<p class="command">% source .cshrc</p>
<p>Check this has worked by typing</p>
<p class="command">% echo $history</p>

<h2>8.6 Setting the path</h2>
<p>When you type a command, your path (or PATH) variable defines in which directories 
  the shell will look to find the command you typed. If the system returns a message 
  saying &quot;command: Command not found&quot;, this indicates that either the 
  command doesn't exist at all on the system or it is simply not in your path. 
</p>
<p>For example, to run units, you either need to directly specify the units path 
  (<strong>~/units174/bin/units</strong>), or you need to have the directory <strong>~/units174/bin</strong> 
  in your path. </p>
<p>You can add it to the end of your existing path (the <strong>$path</strong> 
  represents this) by issuing the command: </p>
<p class="command"> % set path = ($path ~/units174/bin)</p>
<p>Test that this worked by trying to run units in any directory other that where 
  units is actually located. </p>
<p class="command">% cd; units</p>
<p class="hint"><strong>HINT:</strong> You can run multiple commands on one line 
  by separating them with a semicolon. </p>
<p>To add this path PERMANENTLY, add the following line to your .cshrc AFTER the 
  list of other commands.</p>
<p class="sourcecode">set path = ($path ~/units174/bin)</p>
