    - [Tutorial 2: LLDB](02-lldb/index.html)
        - Source code: [prog1.cpp](02-lldb/prog1.cpp.html) ([src](02-lldb/prog1.cpp)), [debug.cpp](02-lldb/debug.cpp.html) ([src](02-lldb/debug.cpp))
- [Tutorial 3: More Unix, part 1](03-04-more-unix/index.html), which is sections 1-4; this tutorial is originally from [here](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
- [Tutorial 4: More Unix, part 2](03-04-more-unix/index.html), which is sections 5-8; this tutorial is originally from [here](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
- [Tutorial 5: make](05-make/index.html), and the necessary [pizza.zip](05-make/pizza.zip)
- Tutorial 6: Shell scripting, part 1
    - This part of the [Wikibooks article on Bash Shell Scripting](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting)
    - In particular, it is [section 1 (introduction)](http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bash_Shell_Scripting#Introduction) through [section 4 (variables)](http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bash_Shell_Scripting#Variables), as well as [section 12 (shell arithmetic)](http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bash_Shell_Scripting#Shell_arithmetic) and [section 14 (input/output)](http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Bash_Shell_Scripting#Input.2FOutput)
- Tutorial 7: Shell scripting, part 2
    - This is the remainder of the [Wikibooks article on Bash Shell Scripting](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting)
- Tutorial 8: assembly
    - ~~32-bit: This two PDF book chapters that are contained in this repository: [x86 Assembly, 32 bit](../book/x86-32bit-asm-chapter.pdf) and [The 32 bit x86 C Calling Convention](../book/x86-32bit-ccc-chapter.pdf)~~
    - 64-bit: This two PDF book chapters that are contained in this repository: [x86 Assembly, 64 bit](../book/x86-64bit-asm-chapter.pdf) and [The 64 bit x86 C Calling Convention](../book/x86-64bit-ccc-chapter.pdf)
        - Another good reading document is the [x86-64 Machine-Level Programming document](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15213-s07/misc/asm64-handout.pdf) from CMU, although they use the other assembly language format
- [Tutorial 9: C](09-c/index.html)
- (no tutorial 10)
