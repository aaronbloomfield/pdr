Program and Data Representation: Utilities
==========================================

[Go up to the main README file](../readme.html) ([md](../readme.md))

The contents of this directory are:

- [markdown.cpp](markdown.cpp.html) ([src](markdown.c)): a file to convert Markdown files using a more modern form of Markdown than the 2004 version that installs with Ubuntu.  See the [Markdown section of the main README](../readme.html#markdown) ([md](../readme.md#markdown)) for more details.
- [markdown.c](markdown.c.html) ([src](markdown.c)): an older program to convert Markdown files (it does not handle codeblocks well between the local Markdown and GFM).  See the [Markdown section of the main README](../readme.html#markdown) ([md](../readme.md#markdown)) for more details.
- [convert](convert): a shell script that will do a first take at converting text files in Radeox wiki format (what all my labs and such were in previously) to Markdown.  Note that this program assumes the cut-and-paste was done on a Mac (if done on a different OS, then there are different characters that are substituted for the non-ASCII characters).
