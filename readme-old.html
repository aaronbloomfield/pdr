<h2 id="introduction"><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>This repository contains the materials for the course entitled “CS 2150: Program and Data Representation” in the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu">Computer Science Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a>. It contains all of the slides, labs, exams, etc., used throughout the course. The course description is <a href="#description">below</a>. The github repository for this course is at <a href="https://github.com/markfloryan/pdr">https://github.com/markfloryan/pdr</a>.</p>
<p>Students <em>currently</em> in the course should view the <a href="uva/index.html">uva/index.html</a> (<a href="uva/index.md">md</a>) file in the <strong>cloned</strong> repository (i.e., don’t try to view it on github.com); current students may also want to view the <a href="uva/daily-announcements.html#/">daily announcements</a>. Note that many of the course materials are modified right before they are needed – for example, this repository will be updated right before the semester starts.</p>
<p>Students who were previously in the course may want to view the current version, or you can view the version from your semester. All semester versions are tagged with an end-of-semester tag of the form “year-semester”. For example, the spring 2014 semester was tagged as <code>2014-spring</code>. To obtain a specific tag, you can enter <code>git checkout tags/2014-spring</code> in an already cloned repository.</p>

<h2 id="course-description"><a name="description"></a>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course is a second-year course for computer science majors. It is the primary data structures course in the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a>’s <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu">computer science</a> curriculum. Unlike many other data structure courses at other institutions, it is intended as the <em>third</em> course in sequence, meaning that students are expected to have taken two semesters of Java (or equivalent, although some of the examples are specifically from Java). The course focuses on how programs and data are represented from the high level down to the low level. For programs, we examine (from high to low): abstract data types, Java code, C++ code, C code, assembly (x86) code, and a customized machine language. For data, we examine (also from high to low): abstract data types, objects, primitive types, and how numbers are encoded (both floats (IEEE 754) and integers (two’s complement)). About two-thirds of this course is programming using C++. The remainder of this course uses other languages, including (in decreasing order): x86 assembly, IBCM (a machine language), C, Objective C, and shell scripting.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.abet.org">ABET</a> course objects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand program representation from the high-level programming language perspective down to the underlying machine level representation, including: number representation, operations, conditionals, and control structures</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic and advanced abstract data types in C++ including: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs</li>
<li>Be able to evaluate asymptotic time and space complexity analysis of programs and data structure implementations using Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation and assess the suitability of a data structure for a particular problem</li>
<li>Understand the basic program execution model and the underlying computer hardware and software (fetch-execute cycle, memory hierarchy, operating system, compiler)</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic program control and data structures in an assembly language (loops, conditionals, subroutines and parameter passing modes, arrays)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown"><a name="markdown"></a>Markdown</h2>
<p>The majority of the content in this repository was created using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. Unfortunately, the only standardized Markdown is very old (2004), and has limited support for many HTML features, such as tables. In the past, there were custom utilities (which can still be found in the <a href="utils/index.html">utils</a> (<a href="tutorials/index.md">md</a>) directory) were used. However, <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> is now used (which is installed via the “pandoc” package on Ubuntu). Typing <code>make</code> in the root repo directory will call pandoc on all the markdown files.</p>
<p>For all the Markdown files in this repository, both the original (.md) file and the HTML version (.html) are added to the repository, so that people who do not have Markdown installed can still view the contents of this repository.</p>
<p>Note that Github supports an enhanced version of Markdown, called <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown">Github Flavored Markdown</a>, or GFM. This mostly pertains to this README file. In an effort to ensure compatibility with other Markdown programs (such as the one described here and what reveal.js uses), GFM specific features are generally avoided. One example is the use of anchors in this document – the HTML tags are included instead of using GFM’s version.</p>
<h2 id="source-code"><a name="sourcecode"></a>Source code</h2>
<p>All source code is formatted via <a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/">astyle</a> and then highlighted via <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/source-highlight.html">source-highlight</a>. Both the original file (foo.cpp) and the highlighted version (foo.cpp.html) are included in the repository. All links to source code will like to the .html, with a “(<a href="README.md">src</a>)” after it to link to the original source code.</p>
<ul>
<li>astyle options: <code>-A2 -s4 -S</code></li>
<li>source-highlight options: <code>-d</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="canvas-notes"><a name="canvasnotes"></a>Canvas notes</h2>
<p>Some of the slides allow pen-based markup of the slides. To add a canvas to a slide (to allow drawing with a mouse or a stylus), you must do a few things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The slide can NOT be Markdown, it must be all pure HTML</p></li>
<li><p>Include the js/canvas.js and css/dhtmlwindow.js scripts, as well as the dhtmlwindow.css CSS file (the two dhtmlwindow.* files are for the calibration feature):</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;js/dhtmlwindow.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;js/canvas.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/dhtmlwindow.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Add an <code>onload="canvasinit()"</code> to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag: <code>&lt;body onload="canvasinit()"&gt;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Add the following immediately after the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag (this is for the calibration feature):</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;dhtmlwindowholder&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Add the following code at the end of the .html file (just before the three script tags):</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;calibratediv&quot; style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;calibratecanvasdiv&quot;&gt;
    &lt;canvas id=&quot;calibratecanvas&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;Your
            browser does not support the canvas tag&lt;/canvas&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;Click the center of the target&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; 
       onClick=&quot;calibratewin.close(); return false&quot;&gt;Close window&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Then, on each slide that you want a canvas on, you add the following:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;insertCanvas();&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>A few other notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The canvas is larger than the slide itself, and the amount, in number of pixels, is the <code>canvas_border</code> variable in the canvas.js file</li>
<li>To add colors, add them to the <code>colors</code> array in the canvas.js file; more color names can be found <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/html5_color_names.htm">here</a></li>
