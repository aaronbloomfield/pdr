<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<li>War and Peace</li>
<li>Les Mis√©rables</li>
<li>Another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_novels">really long book</a> of your choice.</li>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>
<h3 id="pre-lab">Pre-lab</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Read the <a href="../../tutorials/12-objc/index.html">Objective C tutorial</a>; you will need to download the <a href="../..//tutorials/12-objc/helloworld.m.html">helloworld.m</a> (<a href="../..//tutorials/12-objc/helloworld.m">src</a>) file, and submit a linkedlist.m file (the description of what to put in that file is in the tutorial).</li>
<li>Write the Objective C program described in the &quot;Hack Some Objective C code&quot; section of the tutorial, which implements a singly-linked list.</li>
<li>Files to download: <a href="../..//tutorials/12-objc/helloworld.m.html">helloworld.m</a> (<a href="../..//tutorials/12-objc/helloworld.m">src</a>) .</li>
<li>Files to submit: linkedlist.m; if your program uses multiple .m or .h files, that's fine. There is no Makefile submitted with this lab.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="in-lab">In-lab</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>For this in-lab, we won't be taking up much of your time.</li>
<li>How much wrath do you have to vent about the course? How much did it ruin your life? How much did you learn? Let us know -- fill out the course surveys! You can access them through Collab (or SIS? We aren't actually given any information about how students access the course evaluations). On a more serious note, we are very interested in your feedback about the course, and would greatly appreciate your filling out of the course evaluation.</li>
<li>The one text file you must submit for this lab is called suggestion.txt, and it should contain one <em>constructive</em> suggestion as to how to improve this course. Here, constructive means that it could actually be accomplished (so you can't just say &quot;ditch C++&quot; without some sort of suggestion as to what to place in its stead).</li>
<li>Any other comments to pass on? There is always the Collab anonymous feedback for more comments as well.</li>
<li>There will be a review session for the final; details to be announced later.</li>
<li>Make sure you know when the final exam is!!!</li>
<li>File to submit: suggestion.txt</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="post-lab">Post-lab</h3>
<p>There is no post-lab for this lab. Good luck on your finals!</p>
