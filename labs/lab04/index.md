PDR: Laboratory 4: Number Representation
========================================

[Go up to the Labs table of contents page](../index.html)

### Objective ###

To become familiar with the underlying representation of various data types, and to learn how to examine these representations in the debugger.

### Background ###

In class we discussed how various data types -- integers, characters, and floating point numbers -- were represented in computers.  In this lab we will use the debugger to examine some of these representations.

### Tutorial ###

Go through [Tutorial 4: Unix, part 2](../../tutorials/03-04-more-unix/index.html), which is sections 5-8.  This tutorial is originally from the department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Surrey, and is available online [here](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/).  You went through sections 1-4 in the last tutorial; this lab has you completing sections 5-8.

### Floating point conversion ###

To reinforce what we went over in class, you will be converting a floating point number to binary representation, and another number from its binary representation to a floating point number.

First, you will need to determine what your floating point numbers are going to be -- these numbers will be different for each student.  To do so, visit [https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/getfloat.php](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/getfloat.php) and enter your UVa userid.

For example, if you entered 'asb2t', you would get:

```
Your magic (32 bit) floating point number is -35.125
This is the number that needs to be converted to (little endian) binary, and expressed in hexadecimal.

Your other magic floating point number is, in hex, 0x00401f41
This is the number that needs to be converted to a (32 bit) floating point number.
Note that the hexadecimal printed above is in little-endian format!
```

In this example, you would convert -35.125 to 0x800cc2 (or 0x00800cc2 -- same thing with the leading zeros added), and 0x401f41 (or 0x00401f41 -- again, the same thing) to 9.95312.

Note: during the conversion, the numbers provided do not have any 1 bits in the mantissa after the 10th bit.  It could be that your floating point number needs the first 10 bits of the mantissa, or it could need less.  But all bits after the first 10 are supposed to be zero.  So if your conversion has any bits beyond that set to 1, then you are doing something wrong.  You will be expected to be able to do this on a test -- although in an exam situation, because no calculators are allowed, the math involved with determining the mantissa won't be very hard.

Your conversion should be in a PDF file called floatingpoint.pdf.  The idea is to show the math behind the conversion (similar to how was done in class), not to write a program to do it.

You must actually type up your work in a word editor (Word is fine, as is Mac Pages; [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) is a free alternative) and convert it to PDF by following [these instructions](../../docs/convert_to_pdf.html).  You can ***NOT*** do the assignment by hand, then scan it in (or take a photo of it).  The Unix honor pledge only applies to development, so you are free to use anything to type up the file.

**Note: Many students will submit a text file that happens to be called floatingpoint.pdf. Make sure to check for this before submitting!**

### prelab4.cpp ###

There are three parts to the C++ file you will be submitting as a part of the pre-lab.

**Your program should ask for a single integer value for input**, which we will call *x*.  The program will call the three functions below in order: `sizeOfTest()`, `outputBinary(x)`, and then `overflow()`.  Note that only `outputBinary()` takes in *x* as the parameter.

#### sizeOfTest() ####

The size of C++ data types is dependent on the underlying hardware on which you are running.  A programmer may determine the size of various data types by using the `sizeof()` operator.  Although it looks like a function, it's a language construct -- somewhat like `while()` or `if()` -- so it's technically an operator.  `sizeof()` returns the size, in bytes, of a given variable or data type.  Note that you can use `sizeof()` with types, variables, pointers, classes, and objects.

Write a small C++ function that demonstrates the use of `sizeof()` with the following types: `int`, `unsigned int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `int*`, `char*`, and `double*`.  Your function should print out all the types and their respective sizes.  You will use the values outputted by your program to fill in the table in the in-lab section.  The function should be called `sizeOfTest()` (note the capitalization!), so as not to confuse C++ with the `sizeof()` operator.  This function should not take in any parameters.

#### Binary number output ####

The second coding exercise for the pre-lab is a binary output program.  The function to write is called `outputBinary()`, and it will take in one parameter, an `unsigned int`.  It must be unsigned, or else your code may not work!  You should then print out the 32-bit binary representation (this includes the leading 0s!) of the passed parameters in **big Endian** format. For example:

```
outputBinary(1) //=> 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
outputBinary(5) //=> 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0101
outputBinary(1000000) //=> 0000 0000 0000 1111 0100 0010 0100 0000
```

You can ***NOT*** use the `bitset` class for this, or any other class that does the work for you.  You have to program this yourself.

#### The Limits of Representation ####

What do you think will happen when you add 1 to a variable containing the maximum value of a type?  Write a function called `overflow()` to answer the following questions:

- What happens when you add 1 to an `unsigned int` variable containing the maximum value of an `unsigned int`?
- Does the program halt?
- What answer do you get?
- Why does this happen?

Your function should create an `unsigned int`, give it the max value, and add 1 to that.  By printing out the result, you will effectively answer the first 3 of the 4 questions.  Answer the last question in a `cout` statement (NOT as a comment!).  The function takes in no parameters.

### Hints ###

#### Converting to binary ####
Consider first how you might convert a number to binary using pencil and paper, and develop an algorithm.
Next, take a look at left-shifts (`<<`) as well as right-shifts (`>>`) and see if they would be helpful in implementing your algorithm.

#### Storing as binary ####
Remember how we discussed that little-endian often makes more sense to represent numbers.
Even though your function must print the final result out in big-endian,
that does not prevent you from using little-endian for the conversion itself if you find that to be easier to reason about.

#### Finding the max value ####
The header [`climits`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/climits) has constants containing the max values of many types.

------------------------------------------------------------

In-Lab
------

For the in-lab, you will complete the [inlab4.doc](inlab4.doc) worksheet and submit it (in PDF format - see [How To Convert A File To PDF](../../docs/convert_to_pdf.html) for details).  To complete this in-lab, you will write a few small functions to help fill in *some* of the values in the inlab4.doc worksheet; you will combine the functions (and some others) into an inlab4.cpp file.  The sections below named [Representation in memory](#memory) and [Primitive Arrays in C++](#arrays) describe what should be in this file.  It should not take in any input, and should just print out the necessary values.

### Worksheet ###

The [inlab4.doc](inlab4.doc) worksheet asks you to fill in two tables describing certain features of primitive types in C++.  The two tables are reproduced below:

| C++ Type | Size in bytes? | Max value? (base 10) | Zero is stored as (in hex)? | One is stored as (in hex)? |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| int | | | | |
| unsigned int | | | | |
| float | | | | |
| double | | | | |
| char | | | | |
| bool | | | | |

&nbsp;

| C++ Type | Size in bytes? | Max value? (base 16/hex) | NULL is stored as (in hex)? |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| int\* | | | |
| char\* | | | |
| double\* | | | |

To fill in this table, we recommend using a combination of short "test" programs, the debugger, a header file containing max and min values of certain types, the [Number Representation slides](../../slides/03-numbers.html), and deductive reasoning.

Notes:

- The values for the "Zero" and "One" columns should interpreted appropriately for the data type. For example, "zero" is 0 for an `int`, 0.0 for a `float`, `false` for a bool, the character `'0'` for a `char`, etc.
- For pointers, the highest memory address that can be described is the "max value." For `char`s, we want the maximum integer value that may be stored therein.  Finally, booleans only have two possible values, so choose the max and min from these two.
- All hex values should be given in **big-endian**.

### inlab4.cpp ###

There are two parts to the C++ file you will be submitting as a part of the in-lab.

All your code may be written in a single `main()` function that must not require input to run.

#### <a name="memory">Representation in memory</a> ####
This exercise will show you how to read the contents of a particular memory address.  This will be useful for debugging code and for understanding the underlying data representation of abstract data types.

Recall that almost all computers use little-Endian processors.  Thus, 0xd97c34a2 is stored as: `a2 34 7c d9`, with the least significant byte listed first.  However, when you examine the value in LLDB (using the `x/x` command), it will display it in big-endian format, as that is how humans typically think of numbers.

Write a C++ program, called inlab4.cpp, where you consecutively declare variables of these types: `bool`, `char`, `int`, `double`, `int*`, and assign a value of your choosing to each of them.  The last line(s) of the program should print out the values.  Put a breakpoint near the end of the program, but before the last print statement(s).  Once the breakpoint is hit, type expressions to examine the addresses of all of these variables (e.g. `&i`).  Then for each of these variables, view the contents of their addresses (via the `x/x` command from above).

Find one of your `int` variables in memory.  Change its value via the `expr (var) = (value)` (LLDB) or `set variable <var> = <value>` (GDB) command.  Examine the new variable's contents in memory.  Is it what you expected?  Continue the program execution -- did it properly print the changed value?

After completing this section of the lab, you will be expected to understand how to use the debugger to:

- View variables in memory.
- Change an int value from positive to negative.
- Observe interesting/different features in memory (e.g. skipped memory) and be able to explain it.

#### <a name="arrays">Primitive Arrays in C++</a> ####
If you feel you need a bit more background on arrays, there are [readings](../../docs/readings.html#arrays) available.  Note how two (or higher) dimensional arrays are stored in row-major order (as described in the [04-arrays-bigoh slide set](../../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html)) in C++, as opposed to being stored as arrays of arrays in Java.

For this part, you will need to add a bit of code to your inlab4.cpp file.  You program should show a clear separator where the previous section's part of inlab4.cpp ends and where this section's part of inlab4.cpp begins.  The additional code should declare a one dimensional array of ints and a one dimensional array of chars, as well as two-dimensional versions of each:

```
int IntArray[10];
char CharArray[10];

int IntArray2D[6][5];
char CharArray2D[6][5];
```

Assign different values of your choosing into each element of all four arrays.  As above, put a breakpoint in your program after the four arrays have been assigned values.  Find the address of the first element of each array, and type that address into LLDB (via the 'p' command).

Examine where the elements of the four arrays are in memory. You will be expected to understand and be able to explain this representation for the exams.

The final part of the inlab4.doc worksheet involves writing an expression for the address of the (i,j)th element of `IntArray2D` as declared above.  You can assume that (0 &le; *i* < 6), (0 &le; *j* < 5), and an int is 4 bytes.

```
&(IntArray2D[i][j]) = _______________________________________________
```

After you are done, [convert the worksheet to a PDF](../../docs/convert_to_pdf.html).  Remember to include the standard identifying header at the top of all your files (name, date, etc.).  Submit both the worksheet PDF as well as inlab4.cpp.

### Hints ###

#### sizeof ####
For the size in bytes of each type, we can easily use the `sizeof` operator or the `sizeOfTest` function from the pre-lab.

#### Max values ####
`climits` will come in handy here again.
For types not in `climits`, you should reason about how the data is stored and the size of that type.

#### Viewing values ####
For some parts of this lab, it is helpful to assign a value to a variable, then inspect that variable's contents using a debugger.
You can write a simple C++ program that creates the variables, and stores the appropriate value (zero, one, or NULL) into them.
Compile (remember the `-g` flag!), load the debugger, set a breakpoint, and start the program execution.

When using LLDB, you can use the 'x' (for 'eXamine') command to print out the pointee of an address.
Consider the C++ program that has two variables defined, `int i` and `int *p`.
To print out the int variable `i`, you would enter `x &i` (as you have to enter the address of where the data is located).
If `p` is a pointer to a value, you would enter `x p` to print out the *pointee*.
This may print it using many more hexadecimal digits than you wanted,
so you can add a parameter to the 'x' command to have it print only a certain amount:

- `x/xb p`: this will print the one byte at the address that is pointed to by p
- `x/xh &i`: this will print the two bytes of int variable i
- `x/xw p`: this will print the four bytes at the address that is pointed to by p
- `x/xg &i`: this will print the eight bytes of int variable i

Note that you don't want to print out more bytes than the size of the type itself.
If your int is 4 bytes, and you print out 8 bytes,
then the other 4 bytes will be whatever arbitrary values are adjacent in memory.

------------------------------------------------------------

Post-Lab
--------

### Binary bit counter ###

In bitCounter.cpp, create a ***recursive*** function that returns the number of 1s in the binary representation of *n*, which will be passed in as a command-line parameter.  Use the following fact: if *n* is even, the number of 1s in the representation of *n* is the same as that in *n/2*; if *n* is odd, the number of 1s is one more than that in *floor(n/2)*.

You may assume that *n* is a non-negative integer that will be stored in two's complement.  However, *n* will be passed in the standard decimal (i.e. base-10) format.  This should be a rather simple function that uses what you've learned about integer representation.  If you find you need things like global variables or the `pow()` function to implement this then you are going too far.

If your program is run without any command-line parameters, your program should gracefully exit with an appropriate error message.  Your program need not handle an invalid number for the command-line parameter.  Any additional command-line parameters beyond the first should be ignored.

### Command-line parameters ###

So far, our `main()` method has had the following prototype:

```
int main()
```

We will now change that prototype to the following:

```
int main (int argc, char **argv)
```

These two parameters provide you with the command-line parameters.  The first parameter, `argc`, is the number of parameters plus one -- the 0th parameter is always the name of the executable itself (`a.out`, for example).  The second parameter, `argv`, is an array of C-style strings (some people list the type as `char *argv[]` to make this more clear -- either way is fine).

Command-line parameters are passed in as space-delimited values after the executable name:
```
./a.out 3 hi example.txt
```

Here, `argc` would be set to 4, `argv[0]` would be `a.out`, and `argv[1]`, `argv[2]`, and `argv[3]` would be the strings `3`, `hi`, and `example.txt`, respectively.

Command-line parameters are discussed in more detail in the [04-arrays-bigoh slide set](../../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html), along with a source code example showing how to use them.

### Converting between number systems ###

Complete and submit the [radixWorksheet.doc](radixWorksheet.doc) file as a PDF file called radixWorksheet.pdf.  It must be in PDF format!  See [How To Convert A File To PDF](../../docs/convert_to_pdf.html) for details.

### Hints ###

#### Working with command-line parameters ####
Since `argv` is a `char**`, all parameters are stored as C-style strings.
You will need some method of converting your string parameter to an integer that can be passed to your bit-counter function.
Not sure what to do? Look back at Lab 3 for some clues.

#### Flooring values ####
In the real world, `5 / 2 = 2.5`.
In most programming languages, including C++, dividing two integers will also yield an integer
with the fractional portion removed (which is the same thing as flooring).\
Hence, in C++, `5 / 2 = 2`, as division implicitly floors the result.
