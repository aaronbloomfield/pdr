<h1 id="pdr-laboratory-2-linked-lists">PDR: Laboratory 2: Linked Lists</h1>
<p><a href="../index.html">Go up to the Labs table of contents page</a></p>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>This laboratory introduces you to some advanced class development in C++, creating and using iterators, manipulating pointers, and linked data structures. It also addresses some issues involving testing and software development.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>The linked list is a basic data structure from which one can implement stacks, queues, sets, and many other data structures. Lists may be singly- or doubly-linked. In this lab we will implement a doubly-linked list.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>
<p>In this lab, you will have to make a choice as to which debugger to use; this will affect which tutorial you carry out. You can choose the LLDB debugger (you would then complete <a href="../../tutorials/02-lldb/index.html">Tutorial 2: LLDB</a>) or the GDB debugger (you would then complete <a href="../../tutorials/02-gdb/index.html">Tutorial 2: GDB</a>). The source code provided for each tutorial is exactly the same, and the deliverable (i.e., what you turn in) is likewise the exact same.</p>
<p>The LLDB debugger is preferred as it was built with the <code>clang++</code> compiler that we are using; however, the GDB tutorial is offered if LLDB doesn't work for you.</p>
<p>Just remember which one you choose, as you will end up using that debugger throughout this course. And if you ever have to switch between them, you can use our <a href="../../docs/gdb_vs_lldb.html">GDB vs LLDB</a> page to see the (relatively few) commands that are different between the two.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is a low stress choice. Choose LLDB, and only switch over to GDB if you run into issues.</p>

<h2 id="pre-lab-1">Pre-lab</h2>
<h3 id="code-description">Code Description</h3>
<p>Linked lists are described in the online <a href="../../docs/readings.html">Readings</a>.</p>
<p>You will be implementing a doubly linked list, and you will be using &quot;dummy&quot; nodes as well. You will want two dummy nodes -- <strong>one for the head</strong> and <strong>one for the tail</strong>. A benefit of doing your implementation using dummy nodes is that there are fewer special cases to check for -- for example you never have to update the head pointer on an insertBefore() or a remove() -- the head pointer always points to the dummy header node. A dummy tail pointer would help out in the same respect. The downside is that you use two extra &quot;empty&quot; nodes.</p>
<p>For this lab you will need to implement three classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ListNode</li>
<li>List</li>
<li>ListItr</li>
</ul>
<p>For simplicity we will just create a list that holds integers (your code could easily later be templated (i.e. made generic) to allow it to contain objects of other types). You must not modify any of the provided declarations in the header files, though you may add onto the header files as you see fit.</p>
<h3 id="uml-diagram">UML Diagram</h3>
<p>Below is a UML diagram showing how these classes interact with each other.</p>
<figure>
<img src="list-diagram.png" alt="UML diagram" /><figcaption>UML diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This diagram shows a list containing two elements, the integers 3 and 7. Note that there are more methods in the List and ListItr classes than what is shown above. The head and tail pointers in the List class point to dummy nodes -- they are put there to make inserting elements into the list easier. It doesn't matter what the value of the dummy nodes is set to, as it won't be used. Each ListNode points to the nodes before and after it (although the dummy nodes each have one pointer pointing to NULL).</p>
<p>Thus, our doubly linked list will have only one List object and many ListNode objects (2 more than the number of elements in the list). A ListItr is a separate object, which points to one element in the list (possibly a dummy node). As you call the various methods in ListItr to move the iterator forward and backward, the node that it points to will change.</p>
<h3 id="listnode">ListNode</h3>
<p>A ListNode contains an integer value, as well as next and previous pointers to other ListNodes. View the <a href="ListNode.h.html">ListNode.h</a> (<a href="ListNode.h">src</a>) code for details.</p>
<h3 id="list">List</h3>
<p>This class represents the list data structure containing ListNodes. It has a pointer to the first (head) and last (tail) ListNodes of the list, as well as a count of the number of ListNodes in the List. View the <a href="List.h.html">List.h</a> (<a href="List.h">src</a>) code for details.</p>
<h3 id="listitr">ListItr</h3>
<p>A ListItr maintains a pointer to a current position in a List to allow for easy traversal through the List. View the <a href="ListItr.h.html">ListItr.h</a> (<a href="ListItr.h">src</a>) code for details.</p>
<h3 id="test-harness">Test Harness</h3>
<p>We have provided a test harness for testing your whole implementation: <a href="ListTest.cpp.html">ListTest.cpp</a> (<a href="ListTest.cpp">src</a>) <strong><em>Your List must work with this test harness.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>
<p>There are a few things that always cause students some headache. We've tried to explain some of them here, in an effort to lessen the frustration it causes.</p>
<h4 id="getting-started">Getting started</h4>
<p>To start, create all three .cpp files (List.cpp, ListNode.cpp, ListItr.cpp) and include the relevant .h files. Fill the files with empty method bodies (with a dummy return value for non-<code>void</code> methods) and get that to compile. Then start implementing <em>one method at a time, testing as you go</em>.</p>
<p>Here is the minimum amount of functions you need to have implemented in order to start using the ListTest harness, as well as suggested implementation order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All of ListNode (so...the constructor)</li>
<li>List constructor</li>
<li><code>List::insertAtTail</code></li>
<li>All of ListItr</li>
<li><code>List::first</code></li>
<li><code>printList</code></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="segmentation-faults">Segmentation faults</h4>
<p>When beginning to test your code, chances are your program will crash unexpectedly with a message similar to <code>Segmentation fault (core dumped)</code>, commonly referred to as a <em>segfault</em>. Get prepared to see these often throughout the course, as unlike other programming languages like Java, C++ does not give any extra debugging information on a crash. In order to determine where and why your program is crashing, run your code through the debugger and look at the backtrace. Segfaults generally indicate that you are trying to dereference a NULL or invalid pointer, so those are good things to look out for.</p>
<h4 id="the-constructor">The constructor</h4>
<p>By the time the constructor finishes, we should have a functioning (but empty) list. This means that <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> need to be set appropriately! What should they point to if the list is empty?</p>
<p>Make sure you are initializing the variables that are specified in the .h file and <strong>not</strong> declaring new variables that have the same name as those in the header file. Take a look back at lifecycle.cpp's constructors from Lab 1 if you need a refresher.</p>
<h4 id="the-copy-constructor-and-the-copy-assignment-operator">The copy constructor and the copy assignment operator</h4>
<p>The code for the copy constructor and the <code>operator=()</code> method in the List class are shown below. Although we are providing you with this code, you must understand how it works by the end of the lab, as you will have to implement these types of methods on future labs and exams. It also might help you with some of the other methods! (Hint hint.)</p>
<pre><code>// Copy constructor
// Called when the code looks something like List list2 = list1;
// (In other words, it is called when you are trying to construct a **new** list from an existing one)
List::List(const List&amp; source) {
    head=new ListNode();
    tail=new ListNode();
    head-&gt;next=tail;
    tail-&gt;previous=head;
    count=0;

    // Make a deep copy of the list
    ListItr iter(source.head-&gt;next);
    while (!iter.isPastEnd()) {
        insertAtTail(iter.retrieve());
        iter.moveForward();
    }
}

// Copy assignment operator
// Called when the code looks something like list2 = list1;
// (In other words, it is called when you are trying to set an **existing** list equal to another one)
List&amp; List::operator=(const List&amp; source) {
    if (this == &amp;source) {
        // The two are the same list; no need to do anything
        return *this;
    } else {
        // Clear out anything this list contained
        // before copying over the items from the other list
        makeEmpty();

        // Make a deep copy of the list
        ListItr iter(source.head-&gt;next);
        while (!iter.isPastEnd()) {
            insertAtTail(iter.retrieve());
            iter.moveForward();
        }
    }
    return *this;
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that these two methods are correctly implemented. However, they depend on the other methods working properly. If you are seeing crashes in these methods, it is likely because some of the other supporting methods are not working properly.</p>
<h4 id="insert-methods">Insert methods</h4>
<p>When implementing the three insert functions, we have found it helpful to draw out the pointers on paper and determine the order in which to update the pointers <em>before</em> beginning to code the function itself.</p>
<p>For <code>insertAfter</code> and <code>insertBefore</code>, the ListItr you are given is already pointing to a ListNode. You should insert the new ListNode after or before that ListNode, respectively. If you find yourself thinking about loops or iteration, that is unnecessary! Double-check the ListItr header file.</p>
<h4 id="find-and-remove">Find and remove</h4>
<p>Since <code>find</code> needs to return a ListItr, it might make sense to also implement it using iterators, though that is not required.</p>
<p>As <code>remove</code> takes in an integer rather than a ListItr, we first need to determine whether or not that integer exists in our list.</p>
<h4 id="makeempty-and-the-destructor">makeEmpty and the destructor</h4>
<p><code>makeEmpty</code> should clear the list of all elements (<code>isEmpty</code> should return true after calling <code>makeEmpty</code>). It should also make sure that <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> no longer point to those deleted elements (what should they point to instead in an empty list?).<br />
Since we have been dynamically allocating ListNodes, we must also be responsible for deleting them to ensure we do not leak memory. There are multiple ways to iterate through the list and <code>delete</code> each ListNode -- experiment and see what makes the most sense to you.<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> once you delete a ListNode, you can no longer reliably access any of its data, such as its <code>next</code> or <code>previous</code> pointers! To make sure you don't do this accidentally, we recommend setting each ListNode to NULL as soon as you delete it.</p>
<p>The destructor should delete <em>all</em> dynamically-allocated memory, as we no longer need this List instance. Thus, it makes sense that we should delete all the elements we inserted (hint: do we already have a method for that?). However, what else do we dynamically allocate that we need to delete?</p>
<h4 id="compiling">Compiling</h4>
<p>When compiling your code, you must remember to compile all of your .cpp files in one line:</p>
<pre><code>clang++ List.cpp ListItr.cpp ListNode.cpp ListTest.cpp</code></pre>
<p>There are ways to compile these programs in pieces, but we will see this later in the semester.</p>
<p>Linker errors are commonly caused by one of two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Undefined symbols for architecture...</code> or <code>Undefined reference to...</code> means that you forgot to implement some functions, or that you forgot to compile all four files together. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>/tmp/ListTest-8ea7aa.o: In function `main&#39;:
ListTest.cpp:(.text+0x37c): undefined reference to `List::List()&#39;
ListTest.cpp:(.text+0x116d): undefined reference to `List::insertBefore(int, ListItr)&#39;
ListTest.cpp:(.text+0x1d34): undefined reference to `List::List()&#39;
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)</code></pre>
<p>Looks like we forgot to implement the List constructor and insertBefore!</p></li>
<li><p><code>Duplicate symbol...</code> or <code>Multiple definition of...</code> means that you have defined the same function more than once. Make sure you're only including <code>.h</code> files and that you haven't accidentally redefined a function somewhere. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>/tmp/ListItr-6e3849.o: In function `List::insertBefore(int, ListItr)&#39;:
ListItr.cpp:(.text+0x120): multiple definition of `List::insertBefore(int, ListItr)&#39;
/tmp/List-2e4fcd.o:List.cpp:(.text+0x5d0): first defined here
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)</code></pre>
<p>This time, we defined insertBefore twice -- once in ListItr, and once in List. The one in ListItr must be a mistake!</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="in-lab-1">In-lab</h2>
<p>Complete Part II of the tutorial for this lab and submit your debugged version of debug.cpp; we are not submitting prog1.cpp. Remember the standard identifying header information.</p>
<p>Going forward, if you have a post-compilation problem with your program (crash, etc.), the TAs will not help you until you have run it through the debugger and learned all that can be learned from this. So make sure you understand the tutorial!</p>
<p>Verify to yourself that your methods are working properly with your linked list code using the debugger that you just learned about. If you have not yet completed your linked list implementation, use the debugger to help you identify the issues/problems with parts of your current implementation. Consult with a TA if you have questions.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="post-lab-1">Post-lab</h2>
<p>For the post-lab, your goal is to submit a fully-functional version of your doubly-linked list. Finish any methods that you haven't completed yet, and then move on to checking for memory errors.</p>
<h3 id="memory-leaks-and-corruption">Memory Leaks and Corruption</h3>
<p>Even though your code might appear to work correctly, it might still be leaking or corrupting memory!</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>memory leak</em> occurs when you forget to deallocate some memory that you dynamically allocated earlier, which causes your program to hold onto that memory forever until it exits!</li>
<li><em>Memory corruption</em> occurs when your code attempts to access some memory address that it does not have access to, for example, attempting to read or write to a previously-deleted pointer. C++ will blindly dereference a pointer without checking its validity. Clearly, this can cause your program to do unexpected things!</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of errors can cause your host machine to run out of memory and crash, or edit some other file that your program shouldn't have access to! We will be checking that your code does not contain any memory errors because of their potential severity.</p>
<p>You can test for memory errors by compiling your code with special <em>sanitizers</em> enabled:</p>
<pre><code>clang++ List.cpp ListItr.cpp ListNode.cpp ListTest.cpp -fsanitize=address,leak -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g</code></pre>
<p><code>-fsanitize=address,leak</code> turns on two sanitizers: <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html">AddressSanitizer</a> and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html">LeakSanitizer</a>. AddressSanitizer ensures that your code never attempts to reference deleted memory or memory that you do not have access to (i.e., it checks for invalid addresses). LeakSanitizer ensures that anything that is dynamically allocated is also deallocated.</p>
<p><code>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code> helps us obtain better stack traces, so we include it just in case.</p>
<p>We use the <code>-g</code> flag from earlier to indicate that we want to include debugging information such as line numbers.</p>
<p>Now, when we run the executable, AddressSanitizer will <strong>immediately crash upon any invalid behavior</strong>. This is helpful because AddressSanitizer detects when we try to use addresses that we do not control, and thus, we have no idea what will happen when we use them! AddressSanitizer crashes the program because there is no guarantee of what will happen next. If this happens, carefully inspect the stack trace, attempt to fix the error, and recompile.</p>
<p>Here's an example of an AddressSanitizer crash:</p>
<pre><code>==28315==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x6030000003a8 at pc 0x000000519188 bp 0x7ffff83e7910 sp 0x7ffff83e7908

---snip---</code></pre>
<p>Here, we are trying to use a pointer after it has been deleted.<br />
The first stack trace shows where we try to use it -- in this case, in <code>List::makeEmpty()</code> on line 68, column 20.<br />
The second stack trace shows where we deleted the pointer -- right before we used it, on line 67.<br />
The third stack trace is generally less useful, but shows where we allocated memory in the first place.</p>
<p>After fixing all of the bugs AddressSanitizer caught, we can move on to LeakSanitizer, which will print out any leaks that it detected when the program exits. If you exit and there is no extra output, congratulations! That means your program is leak-free.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can look at the stack trace to see what memory you are leaking. Here is an example of a List implementation that forgets to delete <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> in the destructor:</p>
<pre><code>==28454==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 96 byte(s) leaked in 4 allocation(s).</code></pre>
<p>LeakSanitizer will print out where the leaking memory was allocated so that you can figure out what you forgot to delete. In this case, we can see we forgot to delete the objects we created on lines 11 and 10 in the constructor, which just happen to be <code>tail</code> and <code>head</code>, respectively. Now that we know <em>what</em> we are leaking, we can start to think about <em>where</em> in our program we should delete those objects.</p>
<p>Having a program run successfully under AddressSanitizer and LeakSanitizer adds strong assurances towards code correctness!</p>
