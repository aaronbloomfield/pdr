<h1 id="note-that-this-is-the-grade-explanation-for-last-semester-and-will-be-updated-at-the-end-of-this-semester"><strong>NOTE THAT THIS IS THE GRADE EXPLANATION FOR LAST SEMESTER AND WILL BE UPDATED AT THE END OF THIS SEMESTER</strong></h1>
<h2 id="grade-parts">Grade parts</h2>
<p>There were 11 full-length labs, and lab 11 which had only one part (since pre-lab 12 was cancelled). Thus, there were 34 lab parts (11 labs of 3 parts each, plus one lab of 1 part). Lab 5 had the AVL tree worksheet, which counted as 4 more points. So the total number of points for the labs was 34*10+4 = 344. Labs counted for 45% of the final course grade.</p>
<p>Each midterm counted for 15% of the final course grade, even though the total number of points on each midterm was different. The final counted for 25% of the final course grade.</p>
<p>The grade breakdown (how much each part counts for the final grade) is as listed on the <a href="syllabus.html">course syllabus</a> (<a href="syllabus.md">md</a>).</p>
<h2 id="grade-curves">Grade curves</h2>
<p>For both of hte midterms, we gave a 10 percentage point curve; each midterm was worth 15% of the course grade. Thus, 10% of 15% is 1.5%. For two midterms, that means 3.0 points added to everybody's score.</p>
<p>For the final, we gave a 5 percentage point curve; the final was worth 25% of the course grade. Thus, 5% of 25% is 1.25%.</p>
<p>From the exams, we have 3.0+1.25 = 4.25 added to everybody's course grade.</p>
<h2 id="rounding">Rounding</h2>
<p>Yes, we round grades. Note that <code>round(x) == floor(x+0.5)</code>. So we added 0.5 points to everybody's curve to take into account rounding. Note that this means rounding is already taken care of, so if you get an 89.9999999999999999999, it's still a B+, no matter how many times you ask - you don't get to round a second time (in reality, it was an 89.49).</p>
<h2 id="course-curve">Course curve</h2>
<p>The curve so far is 4.25 (from the exams) plus 0.5 (from rouding), for a total of 4.75. We raised that up to 5.5 for the final course curve. Thus, everybody got 5.5 points added to their average (your average being what the gradebook reports). Note that this already includes rounding, so you don't get to round a second time!</p>
<h2 id="pre-lab-10-issue">Pre-lab 10 issue</h2>
<p>There was a mistake in the grading of pre-lab 10. There were 36 students for which an increased grade on pre-lab 10 could potentially help the final course average. Those 36 students had regrades added (and handled) for them. For all other students, the difference between the assigned score for pre-lab 10 and a perfect 10/10 would not have changed their final course grade.</p>
<h2 id="grade-breakdown">Grade breakdown</h2>
<p>As stated at the beginning of the semester, each 10-point &quot;decade&quot; is a separate letter grade range (60-70 is a D, 70-80 is a C, etc.). The exact ranges, taking into account the course curve mentioned above, are below. Note: <strong>the following table <em>ALREADY</em> includes the course curve!</strong> So you take your exact average from the gradebook and see where it lies on this table. And rounding has already been taken into account (see above), so you don't get to round a second time.</p>

<p>Recall that rounding has already been taken into account! Thus, the cut-offs listed above are hard cut-offs.</p>
<p>Note that the A+ range and the D- range follow a slightly different pattern. The A+ range is a percentage of the class (in this case, the top 7 course averages), and thus ended up being 94.0. Also, the D- range extends down a bit more.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-record">Permanent record</h2>
<p>We've enabled the (terrible) Collab gradebook tool, and imported all the grades into there where they will live for all eternity. Or at least until UVa doesn't feel like keeping them around any more...</p>
<h2 id="regrade-statistics">Regrade statistics</h2>
<p>For the spring 2017 semester, there were 10,284 lab grades assigned throughout the semester: 300 students times 34 lab parts is 10,200; the difference was from students who dropped or withdrew from the course. There were 410 regrades that were submitted (3.99% of the graded assignments). Of those, 96 were due to our screw-up on pre-lab 10. That leaves 314 regrades (3.05%). Of those, 41 were due to an extension; that leaves 273 regrades (2.65%). Of those, 126 did not result in a grade change. Thus, not counting extensions and our screw-up on pre-lab 10, there were only 147 regrades (1.43%) that we incorrectly graded the first time.</p>
