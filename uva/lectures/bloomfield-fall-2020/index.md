Professor Bloomfield's Fall 2020 lectures
=========================================

[Go up to the main lectures page](../index.html) ([md](../index.md))

The code, images, and notes linked to from this page is what was discussed during the lecture periods in the fall of 2020 in Professor Bloomfield's 1:00pm - 1:50pm lecture periods.  Some notes about the content on this page:

- The code herein is what was the state at the end of that lecture period; the development of the code helped explain the concepts, and that can be found in the lecture recordings; thus, there are no comments included in the files.
- Any images that were sketched on [sketch.io](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) are included as well (in SVG format).
- Unless stated otherwise in the code comments, all code is compiled with `clang++ *.cpp`.
    - However, a few of the lecture files have multiple programs, and each one will have to be compiled separately (`clang++ <file1>.cpp`, `clang++ <file2>.cpp`, etc.).
- The material gone over will have already been covered in the lecture recordings, but not necessarily that day's lecture recordings -- sometimes the review covers material from a past recording.

### Lecture period content

	- If you want to compile this on a Mac, you need to change the nasm output type from `elf64` to `macho64`, and change the name of the `addOrMult` subroutine to `_addOrMult` (note the initial underscore; this is twice in the program, on lines 9 and 13)
- Lecture 24: Mon, Oct 19 (assembly through slide 5.6)
    - As the lecture recording was posted late, this lecture period went over the content of that recording
