fall 2018, exam 2, question 8


easy, but modifies tree:

1. find max of tree, put into $m$ ($m=14$)
2. delete $m$ from tree
3. find max of updated tree, put into $a$ ($a=12$)
4. insert $m$ back into tree


more better algorithm:

if ( numNodes <= 1 )
    throw error
start at root
find max value $m$
if ( m has no left subtree )
    return m's parent's value
if ( m has a left subtree )
    return findMax of left subtree
