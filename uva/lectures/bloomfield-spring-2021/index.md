Lecture content, spring 2021
============================

[Go up to the CS 2150 page](../index.html) ([md](../index.md))

This page contains the material discussed during lecture times.  You can view previous material in the repo in this directory, but it is not necessarily going to be the same as the material discussed this semester.


The code, images, and notes linked to from this page is what was discussed during the lecture periods in the spring of 2021 in both the 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. lectures.  Some notes about the content on this page:

- The code herein is what was the state at the end of that lecture period; the development of the code helped explain the concepts, and that can be found in the lecture recordings; thus, there are no comments included in the files.
- Any images that were sketched on [sketch.io](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) are included as well (in SVG format).
- Unless stated otherwise in the code comments, all code is compiled with `clang++ *.cpp` or `make` (the latter if a Makefile is present).
    - However, a few of the lecture files have multiple programs, and each one will have to be compiled separately (`clang++ <file1>.cpp`, `clang++ <file2>.cpp`, etc.).
- The material gone over will have already been covered in the lecture recordings, but not necessarily that day's lecture recordings -- sometimes the review covers material from a past recording.
