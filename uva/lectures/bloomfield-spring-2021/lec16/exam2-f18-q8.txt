Fall 2018, exam 2, question 8


Easier way to do this:

1. find maximum element $m$
2. remove maximum $m$
3. find new maximum element $a$
4. insert $m$ back into tree


More better algorithm:

if numNodes <= 1:
    throw error
find max value $m$
    - two possible cases: $m$ has no children (leaf) or 1 (left) child
if $m$ has no children (is a leaf):
    - return parent of $m$
if $m$ has one (left) child:
    - return max of left subtree
