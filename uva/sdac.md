SDAC Accommodations in CS 2150
==============================

Some students will have SDAC ([Student Disabilities Access Center](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/SDAC)) accommodations.  Below is how we handle these accommodations in this course.  Obviously, only the accommodations determined by SDAC apply to you.


- **Extra time on exams:** the midterms are taken during your lab slot.  When your regular lab time is over, just put your pen down, tell the TA that you have extended time, and you can start up again when the next lab section starts -- this means you will have a 15 minute break in the middle.  For semesters with only one lab, you should put your pen down when stated, and when a TA comes to pick up your exam, tell him or her that you have SDAC extended time.  Note that you are also welcome to take it at SDAC.  For the final exam, you will also get the extra time -- but note that the final exam will start at the same time, and will go late.
- **Reduced distraction environment for exams:** please arrange to take it at the SDAC center, and we will submit the exam to them in time.  The dates of the exams -- midterms and final -- are on the course syllabus.
- **Permission to type during an exam:** if this applies to you, we should have a chat about it.  This is a very rare accommodation.
- **Permission to use a calculator on an exam:** if this applies to you, we should have a chat about it.  This is a very rare accommodation.  And note that the exams are specifically designed to not require any arithmetic that would require a calculator.
- **Permission to use a computer to either type or use other assistive technology:** during lecture or lab, that's totally fine.  Anybody is welcome to use a computer (or similar) during lecture or lab.  If this will apply during an exam, have a chat with us, as we don't want the TAs to think you are cheating on an exam because of this.
- **Computerized and printed copy of an exam:** Please arrange to take the exam at SDAC, and they will be able to provide you with both the printed copy and PDF copy, as necessary.
- **Advanced copies of lecture recordings:** all the lectures for the entire semester are available in the git repo (we'll see the git repo on the first day of class), so you can see all the lectures on day 1.  The recordings are made during the lecture time itself, so it is not possible to get those early.
- **Reasonable modification of assignment deadlines:** if you need such an extension on a lab part, then just submit a support request asking for more time.  Be sure to state that this is part of your SDAC accommodations in that support request.  The only concern is that we don't want one lab part to be so late that it causes future ones to also be late -- but if this becomes an issue, we can discuss your particular case.  Note that this accommodation does not apply to exams.
- **Permission to record classes or access class recordings:** We record -- and post -- all the lectures, so this accommodation does not apply to this class.
- **Typing essay portions of exams:** we do not have essay portions on our exams, so this accommodation does not apply.
- **Note-taking:** historically students have not wanted this particular accommodation, as the course structure provides a limited form of notes via the slides, and due to the recordings of the lectures and lecture sessions.  If this accommodation applies to you, and you want it, please let me know.
- **Classroom breaks:** anybody is free to take whatever breaks they feel they need during lecture or lab.
- **Ability to take breaks during an exam:** no problem.  Let the TAs know about this, and that it's an SDAC accommodations.  This typically comes with extra time as well.
- **Access to cell phone for medical purposes:** no problem.  If this is during an exam, let the TAs know why you are using your cell phone.  But if it is a medical emergency, we can do the explanations afterward.
- **Final exam reschedule:** please let me know if the first month of classes if you need to take the final exam at a different time.  You can do this via a support request.  You cannot take the exam early, but can take it late.
- **One exam per day:** similar to the previous one, please let me know if the first month of classes if you need to take the final exam at a different time.  You cannot take the exam early, but can take it late.
- **Reasonable modification of course attendance policy:** we do not require attendance in either lab or lecture, so this does not apply.  If this occurs during an exam, let us know as soon as possible.
