## The End
- Office hours are listed in the [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1ea0dfillqvhlop8d7t0m8afuo%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;amp;ctz=America/New_York); use the [office hours queue](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/queue.php)
  - Office hours will continue through the end of classes (i.e., the end of today); there may be some after that as well (more on that in a bit)
- Labs and grading
  - Grades through [Lab 9](../../labs/lab09/index.html) have been returned
  - [Lab 10](../../labs/lab10/index.html) and [Lab 11](../../labs/lab11/index.html) are out to be graded
    - There was a compilation misconfiguration issue for post-lab 10...
  - [Lab 12](../../labs/lab12/index.html) and [Tutorial 12: Objective C](../../tutorials/12-objc/index.html) are out
    - There was a compilation misconfiguration issue for pre-lab 12, but that seems to be fixed
    - Make sure you are calling `[foo release];` and not `[foo free];`
  - Lab regrades are in progress; you will receive an email when it is handled
  - Starting with the return of lab 10, the regrade window will, by necessity, have to shorten...
- Final exam info on the next slide
- If Collab is down, you can still submit things, just [log in directly](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy)
- [UNIX honor pledges](unix-honor-pledge-f15.pdf): I emailed everybody yesterday who is missing this
- [Lectures are posted online](index.html) in a Flash movie format
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/415219f8-1a72-4ade-a753-b37ec6aecb61/page/37b584bf-c5a5-41e1-bda7-1f2fcbec258e)!  It's through Collab and sooooo lonely.
- [Readings](../../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- [The Course Forum](http://www.thecourseforum.com/) is recruiting developers, if you are interested
- Please fill out the course evaluations!!!
- Today, one way or the other, we will finish with [memory](../../slides/12-memory.html#/), [esoteric programming languages](../../slides/13-esoteric-pls.html#/) and the [course conclusion](../../uva/course-conclusion.html#/)

## Lab 10 (Huffman) and Thanksgiving
- There is class today (duh!), as well as labs tomorrow (November 24th)
- We will not have office hours Wednesday or Thursday of Thanksgiving week
  - Office hours will *likely* pick up again that Sunday (11/29), but details TBA
- The pre-lab will be due as normal
- For the in-lab, you may attend any lab (with the caveat below), or do it from home
  - The caveat is that if a lab fills up, then those who are registered for that lab section get priority
  - Everybody has already been granted the standard 24-hour lab extension
- The post-lab due date has been modified as follows:
  - The post-lab is due Sunday (11/29) by 11:59:59 p.m. instead of Friday by 11 a.m.
  - However, because of this, there will be NO late period for this lab
  - This means that if your post-lab is 1 second late (at the stroke of midnight), it will receive zero credit!
- The intent for all of this is to allow you to be able to travel home (or wherever) for Thanksgiving
  - And if this still ruins your holiday plans, come chat with me
- Note that the next lab (lab 11) is a doozy, so if you put the post-lab off until the last moment, then it's going to cause issues with pre-lab 11

## Lab 10 (Huffman) and Thanksgiving
- There is class next Monday (November 23rd), as well as labs next Tuesday (November 24th)
- We will not have office hours Wednesday or Thursday of Thanksgiving week
  - Office hours will *likely* pick up again that Sunday (11/29), but details TBA
- The pre-lab will be due as normal
- For the in-lab, you may attend any lab (with the caveat below), or do it from home
  - The caveat is that if a lab fills up, then those who are registered for that lab section get priority
  - Everybody has already been granted the standard 24-hour lab extension
- The post-lab due date has been modified as follows:
  - The post-lab is due Sunday (11/29) by 11:59:59 p.m. instead of Friday by 11 a.m.
  - However, because of this, there will be NO late period for this lab
  - This means that if your post-lab is 1 second late (at the stroke of midnight), it will receive zero credit!
- The intent for all of this is to allow you to be able to travel home (or wherever) for Thanksgiving
- Note that the next lab (lab 11) is a doozy, so if you put the post-lab off until the last moment, then it's going to cause issues with pre-lab 11

- Exam this week!
  - All the old exams for this course are in the repo on the [exams page](../../exams/index.html); we do not post solutions
    - And I've instructed the TAs to not respond to solution requests on Piazza -- sorry!
  - There is another, independent review session tonight, but I was not sent information about it...
  - There will not be any office hours this Wednesday or Thursday due to the exam
  - We *hope* to have it graded Thursday night

## Midterm procedure
- This is the procedure for both midterms this semester
- It is taken during your normal lab section
- The first rule of 2150 midterm is that you don't speak about 2150 midterm
  - (Translation: it is an honor violation to speak about it to somebody who has not taken it yet)
- You have to fill out the [bubble footer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/images/exam-footer.jpg) at the bottom of the first page of the exam
  - And put your name and UVa userid at the top of each page
  - And sign the honor pledge
- ~~There will be a review session, likely the evening of the Sunday prior~~
- We hope to have it graded later that week (Thursday evening is our grading party)
  - Its completion will generate my second (of five!) course-wide emails
- There will not be office hours the Wednesday and Thursday of a midterm week
- Obviously, no lab is released at the end of the week prior to the midterm
  - But one will be released the week *of* a midterm for the following week
- Many questions will have a "word limit"...

## Grades and regrades
- Our aim is to return the lab grades "one week" later
  - That means by Monday a week and 3 days after the post-lab is due (late deadline is on a Saturday)
  - We may not always manage this...
- All grading guidelines are posted in the [Collab wiki](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/415219f8-1a72-4ade-a753-b37ec6aecb61/page/cf081a8e-49ca-4fd5-8f6b-5399dafb7268) (*not* in the github repo!)
- You have 10 days, from when it was returned, to submit a regrade
  - Fill them out via the [regrades tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=regrades.php)
- Regrades are ONLY if we did not properly follow the grading guidelines in your homework
  - They are not an opportunity to make up the work!
  - Nor are they an opportunity to dispute the grading guidelines (that should be done in person)
- Regrades will not be handled in a timely fashion!
  - It's the lowest priority, and they often wait until the end of the semester
  - You can see your submitted regrade status via the [regrades tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=regrades.php)
  - You will receive an email when it is handled

## Pop Quiz!

I have started on [Lab 2](../../../../labs/lab02/index.html) (lists), and I think:

2. It's hard, but doable
3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.
