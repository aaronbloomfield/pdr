## github repo
- The [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr) for this course will continue to remain a public repository
  - The license that the repository is released under ([CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)) means it is permanently released into the public domain (albeit with a few restrictions)
- However, this semester's materials will be archived into a *branch* named "spring-2014" (or similar)
- So if you look at it in the future, things may look different
  - You can either use the then-current version, or change back to the spring-2014 branch
  - There are no expected significant changes to the course content planned for next year
  - But I am going to move a bunch of things around
- Note that your currently cloned (checked out) version of the github repo is the "master" branch, which is the branch that will change with future semesters
  - Some things specific to this semester will only live on in the spring-2014 branch, and will be removed from the master branch
- You can clone a specific branch via:
```
git clone -b spring-2014 https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr.git
```
- You can look at the [github repo web site](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr) for the exact branch name

## Lecture 32: Friday, April 4th, 2014

- [Exam 2](../../exams/exam2-s14.pdf) returned!
  - Average was 42.7/72 (59.3%), standard deviation was 10.8/72 (15.0/100)
  - My email was down (again), so I was unable to send an e-mail announcement
  - You will have to view in the 'Exams' tool, as everybody descending on the 'Gradebook' tool puts too much strain on the server
  - We'll go over it today
  - [Regrades](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/regrades.php) are open for 10 days, but be aware of the [frivolous regrade policy](frivolous-regrades.html)
  - I do not yet have any information regarding a curve
- [Lab 9 (x86 part 2)](../../labs/lab09/index.html) and the associated [C tutorial](../../tutorials/09-c/index.html) are out
  - It's usually not viewed as hard a lab as [lab 8](../../labs/lab08/index.html)
- We are catching up with the support requests and the grading...
  - All UVa CMS (faculty) email was down last night...
  - Which is making it hard to get anything done...
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/page/a2056666-5b8f-40b6-8591-f73174a47bbf)!  It's through Collab

  - We'll talk about the regrade procedure once it is returned
- [Lab 2](../../labs/lab02/index.html): is going out to be graded today
- [Lab 3](../../labs/lab03/index.html) is out -- how is it going?
- Upcoming schedule
  - Next week is [Lab 4: Numbers](../../labs/lab04/index.html)
  - The following week is the first midterm (gasp!)
- UNIX honor pledge
  - It was in lab yesterday to be signed; I have them with me
  - If you aren't here today, you can print it out (it's in the repo on the [cs2150/index.html](index.html) page; the direct link is [here](unix-honor-pledge-s14.pdf)), sign it, and bring it to me in lecture
  - You can't use [Geany](http://www.geany.org), which is an IDE, and the default file load action on the lab computers
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format; from [cs2150/index.html](index.html), click on the right-most link in the 'Semester Schedule' table
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/page/a2056666-5b8f-40b6-8591-f73174a47bbf)!  It's through Collab

  - Apparently the default action in the lab computers when double clicking on a .cpp file is loading up [Geany](http://www.geany.org), which is an IDE, so you can't use that...
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format

  - If you need an in-lab extension due to not being able to make lab due to the snow, please submit a support request

## Lecture 3: Friday, January 17th, 2014

- Registration issues: a new lab opened up, AND registraion restrictions removed
  - I will be increasing the caps of the existing labs, but that still won't be enough space in lab section 101 for all 10 people on the wait list...
- Lab 1 is out
  - There is a wiki page [here](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/tool/58e790ee-ac9e-4001-9947-ebf5df8a8df5?pageName=%2Fsite%2F7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c%2Fgetting+the+git+repo+for+the+first+time&action=printview&panel=Main&breadcrumb=0&realm=%2Fsite%2F7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c) on how to get started with the github repo prior to getting the VirtualBox image installed; you'll need this to see *how* to install and configure VirtualBox
  - The VirtualBox image will need [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip it
  - The assignment submission will automatically open Sunday at noon
- Your lab accounts and passwords will be e-mailed to you today or Monday; bring your Linux password with you to lab on Tuesday!
- Lectures are posted online in a Flash movie format
  - From [cs2150/index.html](index.html), click on the right-most link in the 'Semester Schedule' table
  - Apparently Monday's lecture is stuck in a zoom-into-upper-right-corner mode (sorry!)
