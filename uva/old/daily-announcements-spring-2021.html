## Online lab & office hours procedure
- All are held virtually (of course)
- Office hours are 5pm - 11pm on Sun, Mon, Wed, and Thu
    - Your lab section, on Tuesdays, is also office hours (but with a better TA-to-student ratio)
	- You have to attend *your* lab section!  The TAs will check this
- Students should enter themselves into the [office hours queue](https://pegasus.cs.virginia.edu/satori/cs2150-sp2021/queue/)
	- There will be a 'how to contact you' box that you have to fill in
- You can opt to have help via:
    - Slack (via a private message chat): enter your Slack username in the 'how to contact you' box
		- To join the Slack workspace, see the links on the Collab landing page
    - Zoom (a video conference): enter your *personal meeting room ID link* in the 'how to contact you' box
	    - To find your personal meeting room link, go to https://virginia.zoom.us, and follow the login prompts.  Click on the 'personal room' tab, and the link will be displayed there -- it will be of the form https://virginia.zoom.us/j/1234567890
		- You then have to start that meeting so that when the TA connects, they can chat with you
- Please have patience
    - We *think* we have sufficient staffing for all the office hours and labs, but if we don't we'll reconfigure -- but that likely won't be able to happen that day
	- Because a lot of people wait until the last minute to start the lab parts, the waits will be quite long on Monday nights and Thursday nights
