With the advent of the third snow day for M/W/F classes, a number of changes will have to be made to the schedule.  I don't want to delay the lecture progress any more, as that will throw off the timing for all the future labs.  So here goes:

- The in-lab and post-lab for [Lab 7: IBCM](../../labs/lab07/index.html) ([md](../../labs/lab07/index.md)) are canceled
- The pre-lab for [Lab 7: IBCM](../../labs/lab07/index.html) ([md](../../labs/lab07/index.md)), which is the only part of lab 7 that will be due, is now due at Friday at 9 a.m. (the normal post-lab due time) -- thus, you need not make it to office hours today, in the snow, to get help with the pre-lab
- Lab sessions on Tuesdays are optional this week, as there is no in-lab; the TAs will be present, and you can go if you want help with the pre-lab material
- The IBCM material will still be on the exams
- There will be a second IBCM lecture recorded, which you will have to watch on your own; both the [first lecture](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/lectures/08-ibcm-1/08-ibcm-1.htm) and the [second lecture](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/lectures/08-ibcm-2/08-ibcm-2.htm) are on Collab

I'm sorry to have to ask you to watch the videos outside of lecture.  It was only because of the three snow days that this happened...
