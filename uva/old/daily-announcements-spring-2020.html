## Emailed course announcements, 1/2
-  Final exam
  - The final exam will be at the normal time, which is Thursday, April 30th, from 7 pm to 10 pm Eastern time
    - It will be an open note, online exam taken through Collab.  The "open note" means anything that is in the course repo or notes that you have taken; it does not mean "open Internet".
	- It will be timed, so you will have a fixed amount of time to complete the exam (that time will not be the full 3 hours since we are not expecting to give you a full-length final exam).
	- Those who have extended time due to SDAC accommodations will get it, which I will handle in a separate email in a day or so.
    - Those who have exam conflicts will also be handled in a separate email in a day or so.
    - If you have significant time-zone issues, such as being in Europe which would cause the exam to be in the middle of the night, let me know via a response to this email.
  - There will be an online final exam review session via Zoom; details to follow, but we are expecting it to be Tuesday evening.
- Labs & Lecture
  - Labs 5-7 have just been returned; labs 8-10 are out being graded.
  - We are hoping to have all the labs graded by the end of *next* week (i.e., the day after the final exam).
  - There will be no lecture this Friday, but there will be one Monday and Wednesday of this week, as well as next Monday.
    - Thus, there won't be a lecture discussion Friday, either.
  - There will not be a lab 12 this semester.
	  </script></section>

## Emailed course announcements, 2/2
- Course grades
  - The grading distribution will be 20% exam 1, 25% final, and 55% labs; the online gradebook does not yet have this new distribution factored into it yet.
  - As per the provost's email, which you can see summarized here, the default grading is NC/GC/C: no credit, general credit, and credit.  For this course, a letter grade of F would receive a grade of NC (no credit), a letter grade of D- through a D+ would receive a grad of GC (general credit), and a letter grade of C- or above will receive a grade of C (credit).
    - Note that this is slightly different than what was in the provost's email: specifically that, for this course, a letter grade of C- will receive a grade of C (credit): effectively, to make this work, all those who would have received a letter grade of C- will be "promoted" to a letter grade of C.
    - As for satisfying the CS 2150 pre-req, a grade of NC (no credit) or a grade of GC (general credit) will NOT count as having fulfilled the CS 2150 pre-req that is in place for most electives (similarly a letter grade of D+ or below doesn't count as fulfilling the pre-req).

## Exam 1 issues
- My grand solution to not count question 14 (the big-Theta question) was met with a lackluster reception
- So, taking into account the fact that you all disliked my solution...
- Question 14 has now been regraded
- The new average for the exam is 31.44/60 (65.5%) with a stdev of 8.6 (17.8%)
  - The curve will still be 15 *percentage* points
- The grading guidelines will be released later today, and the regrades open for "10" days
  - Until the Friday *after* spring break
  - So here 10 days == 19 days (see!  10 is a prime number!)

1. It's easy!
2. It's hard, but doable
3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.
5. I wasnt' speaking to you since lab 2 anyway...

## Exam 1 issues
- Question 14 (the big-Theta proof) was graded incorrectly
  - This was my fault, as I didn't prep those grading it regrading how I went over it in class
- What will happen is that this question will not count at all toward the exam score
  - So the exam will be out of 42 points rather than 48 points
- All of your exams will be re-generated with the updated scoring, although the comments will remain
- This will take some time to do -- hopefully by Monday
- At that point, the grading guidelines will be released and regrades will open
  - The regrades will stay open until well after spring break
  - Please be aware of the [frivolous regrade policy](frivolous-regrades.html) before you submit a regrade!
- The curve will still be 15 *percentage* points

## Returning of lab grades
- We aim to have them returned one "week" later
  - Read: 10 days after the post-lab is due
- So lab 1 is to be returned today
- Grading guidelines are posted in the Collab wiki
- Once returned, you have one "week" (read: 10 days) to submit a regrade
- A regrade is ONLY if we screwed up the grading
  - It is NOT a chance for you to re-do the work
- We will be VERY strict about the 10 day regrade window!
- You can fill out a regrade via the [regrades course tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/regrades.php)
