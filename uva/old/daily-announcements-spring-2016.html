## Course Manager Data Loss
- Due to a database "issue", two weeks of data was lost in the course management system
- What was *not* lost:
  - All of your submissions (they are kept on the filesystem)
  - All support tickets (we receive emails about these, which were used to re-populate the database)
- What was lost:
  - Some of the regrades submitted during this time
    - However, that would *only* have been lab 5 regrades, and that window has been re-opened until one week from today
    - Thus, if your lab 5 regrade does not appear for you, then you will have to re-submit it
  - A few lab extensions for labs 7, 8, and 9
    - We got most of them:  we re-did the extensions for everybody for in-lab 7 and post-lab 7 that were due to the server crash, and everybody was given the standard 24-hour extension for in-lab 8
    - But if you had one that was not listed above, please submit a support ticket
  - All the grades for labs 6 and 7, which were about to be returned
    - Sigh.  And we were almost caught up.
- What this means
  - If you submitted a lab 5 regrade, and it's not there, please re-submit it within the next week
  - If you had a lab extension that is not of the ones listed above, please submit a support ticket
  - Grading may take yet more time...

## Pop Quiz!

I have started on [Lab 6](../../../../../../../../labs/lab06/index.html) (hashes), and I think:

1. It's easy!
2. It's hard, but doable
3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.

  - The [arrays section](../../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/arrays) is fair game
  - The [orders of growth section](../../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/growth) will be covered at a very light level (meaning: you should be able to state the run-time of various algorithms we studied -- which has already been covered -- but we won't ask you to do big-Oh proofs)

## Midterm procedure
- This is the procedure for both midterms this semester
- It is taken during your normal lab section
- The first rule of 2150 midterm is that you don't speak about 2150 midterm
  - Translation: it is an honor violation to speak about it to somebody who has not taken it yet
- You have to fill out the [bubble footer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/images/exam-footer.jpg) at the bottom of the first page of the exam
  - And put your name and UVa userid at the top of each page
  - And sign the honor pledge
- There is typically a review session, likely the evening of the Sunday prior
- We hope to have it graded later that week (Thursday evening is our grading party)
  - Its completion will generate the second (of five!) course-wide emails
- There will not be office hours the Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of a midterm week
- Obviously, no lab is released at the end of the week prior to the midterm
  - But one will be released the week *of* a midterm for the following week
- Many questions will have a "word limit"...

## Lecture 13: Wednesday, February 17th
- Office hours are in full swing; see the [Google calendar](https://t.co/9kRXZnqkxZ) for details
- [Lab 4](../../labs/lab04/index.html) (numbers) and the [tutorial](../../tutorials/03-04-more-unix/index.html) (Unix, part 2) is out
  - You can get your floating point number at http://libra.cs.virginia.edu/getfloat.php
- We'll talk about the snow day implications next...
- Next week is the first midterm.  Yay!
- Grades through [lab 2](../../labs/lab02/index.html) have been returned; you can view them in the [course gradebook](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/gradebook.php)
  - ... and then we realized that there was a screw-up on in-lab 2 and post-lab 2, so more on that in a few days (they are all going to be regraded)...
  - Grading guidelines are on the Collab wiki (*not* in the repository!)
  - [Regrades](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/regrades.php) must be submitted within 10 days
- Remember that you ***MUST*** do the in-labs from a lab computer!  You can't use your own personal laptops in that room.
- Lecture recordings are posted online in a Flash movie format; see the [uva/index.html](index.html) file for the links
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/directtool/c9a32516-382f-449d-86b1-f738d75a2015/)!  It's through Collab

## Our second snow day...
- Everybody got a 2 day (48 hour) extension on pre-lab 4, so it is now due on Thursday at 9 a.m.
  - This allows us to finish presenting floating point number conversion today, which is needed for the pre-lab
  - This also allows one to attend the Wednesday evening office hours if you need extra help
- No extensions on the in-lab 4 or post-lab 4, since they are independent of the pre-lab
- We are going to try to *not* have a pre-recorded lecture for you to watch
  - We think that we can get through the material "in time"
  - Here, "in time" means before you have to implement it in a lab...
- We'll keep you updated over the next week or so as we see how the schedule plays out...

## Critically important anonymous feedback
Dear Professor Floryan, I, and a few peers had some questions about your immaculately kept scalp. 1) Do you shine your head? 2) If yes, how long does it take you to shine your head? 3) What do you use to shine your head? 4) Have you ever tried turtle wax? 5) What do you use to shave your head? If, for some reason, we've been lied to and this is in fact not anonymous, please know that only one of these questions is mine. Cheers, A student who rather enjoys your class PS. Please answer these hard-hitting questions in class.
