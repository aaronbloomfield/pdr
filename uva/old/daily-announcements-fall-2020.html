## Lecture 18: Mon, Oct 5th
- [Lab 5](../../labs/lab05/index.html), on trees, is out
- Office hours and lab reminders
    - We are aware of the long waits, and we have implemented a few changes (see [here](#/ohchanges)) to address these
    - You have to go to your actual assigned lab section!  The TAs will be checking that this week.
- UNIX honor pledge
    - We [talked about this](course-introduction.html#/unixhonorpledge) in the first lecture
    - It's a Google form, and the link is [https://forms.gle/19AZdVjwSyUyasjZ9](https://forms.gle/19AZdVjwSyUyasjZ9) (that's posted on the Twitter announcement feed as well)
- Grades and Gradescope
    - You should now be able to see the test cases that were run on your assignments, and can (from there) figure out what failed
    - Gradescope does not handle individual extensions, but we have developed a solution (almost implemented) to handle this and are working on implmenting it...

## Office hour changes
- In an effort to balance the TA time among all the students that need help during office hours, and to lower the queue wait times, we are making the following changes
- The TAs are no longer allowed to "pre-grade" assignments
    - Or "check them over" before submission, or "make sure they are right" -- this is your job as a programmer to try these possibilities
	- The reason is that we just don't have the staffing levels for all the TAs to pre-grade the assignments for the entire class, nor is this a fair or even distribution of TA help among the students
- The TAs will not "watch you code" -- if you don't have a (prepared and ready) question to ask, they will disconnect to help the next student in the queue
- All office hour help sessions are limited to 5 or 10 minutes
    - After you get helped, you can always go back on the queue if you have more questions
	- If a TA cannot find the problem in that 5 or 10 minutes, they will either give you directions to help you determine where the error is or bounce you to another TA (bypassing the queue)
	- Keep in mind that the TAs job is not to necessarily find your bug, but to help you figure out ways for you to find it

## Online lab & office hours procedure
- All are held virtually (of course)
- OP are 5pm - 11pm on Sun, Mon, Wed, and Thu, and your lab section is on Tuesday
- Students should enter themselves into the [office hours queue](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php)
    - It's not yet configured, but will be by Sunday evening
	- There will be a 'how to contact you' box that you have to fill in
- You can opt to have help via:
    - Slack (via a private message chat): enter your Slack username in the 'how to contact you' box
		- To join the Slack workspace, see the links on the Collab landing page
    - Zoom (a video conference): enter your *personal meeting room ID link* in the 'how to contact you' box
	    - To find your personal meeting room link, go to https://zoom.us, and log in via 'sign in with SSO'; enter 'virginia' as the company domain box, and you will be redirected to Netbadge to log in.  Click on the 'personal room' tab, and the link will be displayed there -- it will be of the form https://virginia.zoom.us/j/1234567890
		- You then have to start that meeting so that, when the TAs connect, they can chat with you
- Please have patience
    - We *think* we have sufficient staffing for all the office hours and labs, but if we don't we'll reconfigure -- but that likely won't be able to happen that day
	- Because a lot of people wait until the last minute to start the lab parts, the waits will be quite long on Monday nights and Thursday nights
