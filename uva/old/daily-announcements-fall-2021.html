## Final exam information
- It is 7pm to 10pm on Tuesday, December 14th
  - You cannot take it early
  - Only those who have let us know they have conflicts can take it at an alternate time
    - We'll get back to you in a day or two about the alternate time
- You must bring your UVA ID to the exam!
- Location:
  - Floryan's section (11am) will be in the lecture classroom (Ridley G008)
  - Both of Bloomfield's sections (1pm and 2pm) will be in Physics 203 & 204
- We expect there to be TA office and professor hours later this week, and we will post about those once we know the details
- There will be a (Zoom) review session -- likely Sunday evening starting at 8pm, but specifics to follow
- We *hope* to have it graded by Wednesday evening, but no promises
- Previous exams are in the repo on the [exams page](../../exams/index.html)
  - We still don't have solution keys
- Regrades will be more constrained, as it's the end of the semester
  - We are going to have a much shorter regrade window (like 24 hours); we'll email the class when that's started
  - We will have much less patience for frivolous regrades

## Regrades
- You can submit a regrade request if we mis-graded your exam
  - Submission is through Gradescope
- You need to expalin clearly (and BRIEFLY) why your answer should get more credit
- Did you lose points because your exam was hard to read?
    - The scanner had some issues with exam writing that wasn't dark enough
    - Please type up what you wrote in the exam regrade, and we'll regrade it without penalty
	- If you can't read it either, we'll look up the paper exam
- If you submit regrades that do not get points back, we reserve the right to LOWER your overall exam grade
    - We are trying to prevent frivolous regrades, and to prevent everybody from having us regrade their entire exam when it was graded properly the first time
- Regrades open today (Frdiay, 10/1) at 3pm, and close about 10 days later (Monday, 10/11) at the end of the day
    - Regrades will not be accepted outside that time window
