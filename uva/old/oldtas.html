Hello, my name is Penn Bauman and this is my first semester TAing 2150. I'm a 3rd year Computer Science major and Physics minor. In my free time I've experimented with many Linux distros and desktop environments. So if you need tips on setting up a Linux dual boot I can help.

My name is Annie and I'm a 4th year BA computer science and math double major and I'm from Charleston, SC. Outside of classes, I like to be outside! I love to climb and bike and hike, but when I'm inside, I like to read and watch movies. This summer after job prospects fell through, I drove from Charlottesville to Seattle by myself camping and hiking along the way, so hit me up if you want to hear some funny stories about that. This is my first semester as a TA for 2150, but I've been a TA for CS 1110 and DSA I&II. Looking forward to working with you all!

Hi, I'm a 4th year majoring in CS in the E-School! I am interested in cybersecurity and back-end development, and I want to learn more about ML and cloud. I'm a TA for 2150 because I really like helping people (especially with code) and since I used OH a lot when I took the course, I wanted to give back a little bit.

Outside of CS, I am also heavily involved in the music department (I almost always have a concert coming up...tickets are free ?) and participate in UVA's Aero Design Team, where we design, build, and fly remote-control aircraft. In my free time, you can often find me playing my violin at Old Cabell, or climbing at Slaughter if I'm feeling athletic.<p>Fun fact: I love carrying fruit snacks in my backpack, and usually carry a handful of packs with me. If you ever need a sugar boost, hit me up! Hopefully I'll still have a few left by the end of the day...

Hi! I am a second year BACS major and this is my first time being a TA. I am really excited because CS 2150 was my favorite class last semester.<p>I lived in Korea (NOT NORTH) for 17 years and now live in Fairfax, Virginia. So, my English is not 100% perfect, but I'll try my best to communicate with you. On weekdays, I mostly do homework and watch lectures. On weekends, I do homework, watch lectures, and read textbooks!
