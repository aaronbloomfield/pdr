## Ellen Herrera
Hi! My name is Ellen Herrera. I am a second-year with a BACS major and an intended minor in Chinese. I am from Short Pump, Virginia. In my free time I love to run, watch movies, and explore the Charlottesville area with my friends! I don't really have a favorite movie, but some movies I have watched and really liked include Free Guy, most Adam Sandler movies, Encanto, and Crazy Rich Asians. I got into CS because I love to learn coding languages in addition to my love for my English, Spanish, and Chinese skills. I am very excited to be a CS2150 TA this semester because I found the class to be very informative and essential to my computer science education. As I move forward in my CS classes, I continue to have an intense appreciation for the skills CS2150 equipped me with, and I'd like to help other students gain that same expertise.<br clear='all'>

Hey everyone, welcome to CS2150! I'm a 4th year CS and Econ major who's really excited to finally TA for this course - it is the one I learned the most in and will also truly prepare all of you for just about every CS course afterwards. While I don't have many extracurriculars outside of class, I'm pretty involved with different jobs across grounds. This class may seem/feel/be a bit overwhelming at times, but at the end you will realize it was all necessary. And some of you will truly appreciate C++ over other languages after this :) I look forward to helping you all this semester!

Hey Friends! My name is AJ Cuddeback and I'm a second year from Medford, Massachusetts studying computer engineering and physics. Outside of TAing and classes, I do physics research, resident-advise a first year dorm, and an officer in Outdoors at UVa. I'm really into my chacos, and my diet primarily subsets of peanut butter Clif bars and Dunkin Donuts iced coffee. I am also emotionally attached to my Nalgene. If you're not sure where I am, you can probably find me climbing at Slaughter or scooping up deals at the local Goodwill. Like Dwight Schrute, I always keep an extra set of Birkenstocks in the car for special occasions.

Hi! I'm a third year CS major from northern Virginia. This is my first semester being a TA for 2150, and I'm excited to help with this class! Although I won't deny that I found 2150 challenging, I also really enjoyed it, and I hope you will as well! When I have any free time (and also sometimes when I don't), I like to draw, read, watch movies, and attempt to keep my plants alive. I'm looking forward to meeting you all!

It's also a great opportunity to not only share a bit of my knowledge and experience, but also solidify my own fundamentals as well so I look forward to it.<p>As a TA, I hope to guide you as well as I can, and I'll always be rooting for ya. (As a side note, I know academics and "career building" endeavors are important, but please remember to take a step back and relax. Nothing is more important than your mental and physical well-being, especially now.)<p>I'm excited to work with you all this semester!<p>Here's one of my favorite quotes I keep in mind:  <i>"..we can't concern ourselves with what was.

Hi everyone! I'm Steven Yi, a third-year CS major in the engineering school. I became a TA because I really enjoyed taking this course and really like helping explain CS concepts to people. Outside of CS, I am also heavily involved in the music department (I almost always have a concert coming up...tickets are free ?) and participate in UVA's Aero Design Team, where we design, build, and fly remote-control aircraft. In my free time, you can often find me playing my violin at Old Cabell, or climbing at Slaughter if I'm feeling athletic.<p>Fun fact: I love carrying fruit snacks in my backpack, and usually carry a handful of packs with me. If you ever need a sugar boost, hit me up! Hopefully I'll still have a few left by the end of the day...
