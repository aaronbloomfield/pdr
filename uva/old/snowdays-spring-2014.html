<hr />
<p>With the advent of the third snow day for M/W/F classes, a number of changes will have to be made to the schedule. I don't want to delay the lecture progress any more, as that will throw off the timing for all the future labs. So here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The in-lab and post-lab for <a href="../../labs/lab07/index.html">Lab 7: IBCM</a> (<a href="../../labs/lab07/index.md">md</a>) are canceled</li>
<li>The pre-lab for <a href="../../labs/lab07/index.html">Lab 7: IBCM</a> (<a href="../../labs/lab07/index.md">md</a>), which is the only part of lab 7 that will be due, is now due at Friday at 9 a.m. (the normal post-lab due time) -- thus, you need not make it to office hours today, in the snow, to get help with the pre-lab</li>
<li>Lab sessions on Tuesdays are optional this week, as there is no in-lab; the TAs will be present, and you can go if you want help with the pre-lab material</li>
<li>The IBCM material will still be on the exams</li>
<li>There will be a second IBCM lecture recorded, which you will have to watch on your own; both the <a href="https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/lectures/08-ibcm-1/08-ibcm-1.htm">first lecture</a> and the <a href="https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/7d8b39e0-ac9d-48c1-ab42-c3ca20dfb23c/lectures/08-ibcm-2/08-ibcm-2.htm">second lecture</a> are on Collab</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry to have to ask you to watch the videos outside of lecture. It was only because of the three snow days that this happened...</p>
