- Our plan is to grade it that evening, and for the course grades to be submitted the following Monday
- There will be a review session, likely the Wednesday before

## Lab 10 (Huffman) and Thanksgiving
- There is class today (November 24th), as well as labs tomorrow (November 25th)
- We will not have office hours Wednesday or Thursday of this week
  - Office hours will *likely* pick up again on Sunday, but details TBA
- The pre-lab will be due as normal
- For the in-lab, you may attend any lab (with the caveat below), or do it from home
  - The caveat is that if a lab fills up, then those who are registered for that lab section get priority
  - Everybody has already been granted the standard 24-hour lab extension
- The post-lab due date has been modified as follows:
  - The post-lab is due Sunday by 11 p.m. instead of Friday by 11 a.m.
  - However, because of this, there will be NO late period for this lab
  - This means that if your post-lab is 1 second late (11:00:01 p.m. on Sunday), it will receive zero credit!
- The intent for all of this is to allow you to be able to travel home (or wherever) for Thanksgiving
- Note that the next lab (lab 11) is a doozy, so if you put the post-lab off until the last moment, then it's going to cause issues with pre-lab 11
