## Lecture 42: The End
- Lab 12: inlab is a survey, which you can find in the [in-lab 12 lab document](../../labs/lab12/index.html)
- Office hours end after today
    - TA office hours are 5pm - 11pm on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday
      - They are in the Thornton Stacks (second floor of Thornton A-wing), and the TAs will (eventually) be wearing our [TA t-shirts](https://twitter.com/UVaCS2150/status/829727019936124929/photo/1)
    - Faculty office hours are M/W 9-10 & F 1-2 for Bloomfield and Tue/Wed 10:00-11:30 for Floryan on Zoom
      - His zoom link is on the Collab landing page
    - You can only utilize online office hours if you have COVID-19 or were (potentially) exposed; fill out the form whose link is on the Collab landing page
      - Then, in the OH queue, put in your Zoom personal meeting room (or another zoom meeting)
      - You have to be in that meeting when the TA connects!
- The TAs will still have labs tomorrow -- you can use it as an exam review
- Final exam: Saturday, May 7th, from 7pm to 10pm
  - The exam is in Wilson 301 & 402
  - SDAC went out last night
  - Those who have exam conflicts will receive their information soon
- We are now using a [new support ticket system](https://andromeda.cs.virginia.edu/satori/tickets/ticket-list/cs-2150-sp-2022/)
- Course links are on the Collab landing page
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/x/PKCuAc)!  It's through Collab
- [Readings](../../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- Today we start (and finish) [esoteric programming languages](../../slides/13-esoteric-pls.html#/) and then the [course conclusion](course-conclusion.html#/)
    </script></section>


    <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Final exam information
- It is 7pm to 10pm on Saturday, May 7th
  - The exam is in Wilson 301 & 402
  - SDAC accommodations went out last week
  - Those with final exam conflicts received their information last night
  - You cannot take it early
- You must bring your UVA ID to the exam!
- Location: Wilson 301 & 402 (either room)
  - When one fills up, the TAs will guide you to the other room
- We expect there to be TA office and professor hours later this week, and we will post about those on Piazza once we know the details
- There will be a (Zoom) review session -- likely Thursday evening starting at 8pm, but specifics to follow
- We *hope* to have it graded on Sunday, but no promises
- Previous exams are in the repo on the [exams page](../../../../exams/index.html)
  - We still don't have solution keys
- Regrades will be more constrained, as it's the end of the semester
  - We are going to have a much shorter regrade window (like 24 hours); we'll email the class when that's started
  - We will have much less patience for frivolous regrades
