## That Pesky Honor Policy
- You know, that thing that states, "I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment"
- We've been dealing with cheating cases over the last few days
- Remember that cheat checker that we mentioned at the end of the [trees](../../slides/05-trees.html#/) slide set?
  - It's real and it works
  - We used to use [moss](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/), but now use [etector](http://etector.org/)
- A few reminders
  - Assignments are not group assignments
  - You cannot copy code from an online source, including an online github repo
  - Posting *your* code in an online github repo is also an honor violation, even if it happens *after* the semester is over
  - And, really, if you are going to copy code, at last change your name in it...
