## Lab 9 information
- Office hours tonight (Monday, Apr 8th) are cancelled for obvious reasons
  - We are aiming to have the Monday TAs attend Wednesday's office hours for extra staffing
- Everybody has a 2 day extension on pre-lab and in-lab 9
  - So pre-lab 9 is due by Thursday morning at 8 a.m.
  - In-lab 9 is due by the end of the day on Thursday
- For the post-lab, we are currently thinking we will give a 1 day extension, but full details on Wednesday
- Regardless of the status of post-lab 9, pre-lab 10's due date won't be extended :-(
