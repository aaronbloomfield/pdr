## Solving Common First Week CS 2150 Course Issues
1. Unable to submit (or see Collab) due to not (yet) being enrolled
  - Once you are enrolled, submit a support request, and we will give you extensions for the first lab so that you are not penalized.  You can view the course materials online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr; Collab will become visible once you are enrolled
2. You were unable to submit the in-lab (*or* to submit an extension) due to the Great Lab One Internet Outage (or due to not having an account)
  - Submit a support request, and we will handle that for you as well
3. Virtual Box prevented you from submitting the pre-lab on time
  - Submit a support request, and we will handle that for you as well
4. Virtual Box is not yet installed (or not working)
  - Come to office hours right away to get this solved; we will give you extensions on lab 1 for this, but not on lab 2
5. You don't have a Linux account in Olsson 001 due to a late registration
  - You will receive it early next week (Monday), in time for lab 2; also see #2

Basically, we are not going to be jerks due to problems with enrollment, Internet outages, or Virtual Box installations.  At least for lab 1; for lab 2, all bets are off.
