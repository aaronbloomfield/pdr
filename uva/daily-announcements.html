- The room capacity is 90
- I had the course cap increased to 90, so everybody on the wait list should be able to enroll
- This should close out the registration issues
- I will give all of those people extensions on prelab 1 and inlab 1 until Friday at 10am
  - However, I can't do that until you are in the course roster
  - So please submit a support request
  - It's fine if this takes a few days to resolve itself

- This room has a fire marshal limit of 90 students
  - We want accommodate everybody we can in the course, but we cannot go above the fire marshal limit
- For those on the wait list:
  - Please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuUPjkBhif77d5jb4J4k2JSc_wA8VojTzHRAz_nvWx5SSQiA/viewform)
  - Easier URL to remember: [https://tinyurl.com/2kt38zpw](https://tinyurl.com/2kt38zpw)
- If the number enrolled plus those on the wait list drops to 90 or lower, everybody will be allowed in
- If you don't fill that out, we will not let you into the course!
- We will start handling these sometime early this week
  - You'll get an extension on lab 1

## Course registration issues
- Clarification: if you are *currently* in the class, you are not going to be forced to drop it, even if you are a minor
  - Sorry if I was unclear on that last time
- Currently there are 76 students enrolled and 17 on the wait list
  - If you are not on the wait list, you are not going to be considered for a spot in the course
- This room has a fire marshal limit of 90 students
- We will accommodate everybody we can in the course, but we cannot go above the fire marshal limit
- For those on the wait list:
  - Please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuUPjkBhif77d5jb4J4k2JSc_wA8VojTzHRAz_nvWx5SSQiA/viewform)
  - Easier URL to remember: [https://tinyurl.com/2kt38zpw](https://tinyurl.com/2kt38zpw)
- We will start handling these early next week
  - You'll get an extension on lab 1
