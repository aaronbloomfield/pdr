## Lecture 5: Friday, Jan 27th
- Office hours are in full swing, and are all listed on the [Google calendar](https://t.co/9kRXZnqkxZ)
- Lab capacity is set to 45 (the maximum possible) for all labs; no more labs will be created
- [Lab 1](../labs/lab01/index.html) and [tutorial 1](../tutorials/01-intro-unix/index.html): how did they go?
- [Lab 2](../labs/lab02/index.html) and the tutorial (debugging) are out
  - It's not an easy lab, so please don't wait until the last minute!
- Final exam conflict?  Please fill out a [support request](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/support.php) by the end of January
  - We will respond, soon, to those who have already done so
- Lecture recordings are available online from the [uva/index.html](index.html) page
- Clarification: the post-labs are due by *noon* on Friday, not 1 p.m.
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/directtool/5cb9faf8-a234-47f1-b29a-4698cf245b48/)!  It's through Collab
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- Today we will continue with [C++](../slides/01-cpp.html#/), which will take us into next week
  - I updated some of the pointer-related slides, so what you will now find in the repo will not exactly match what is on the video recordings...

## Solving Common First Week CS 2150 Course Issues
1. Unable to submit (or see Collab) due to not (yet) being enrolled
  - Once you are enrolled, submit a support request, and we will give you extensions for the first lab so that you are not penalized.  You can view the course materials online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr; Collab will become visible once you are enrolled
2. You were unable to submit the in-lab (*or* to submit an extension) due to the Great Lab One Internet Outage (or due to not having an account)
  - Submit a support request, and we will handle that for you as well
3. Virtual Box prevented you from submitting the pre-lab on time
  - Submit a support request, and we will handle that for you as well
4. Virtual Box is not yet installed (or not working)
  - Come to office hours right away to get this solved; we will give you extensions on lab 1 for this, but not on lab 2
5. You don't have a Linux account in Olsson 001 due to a late registration
  - You will receive it early next week (Monday), in time for lab 2; also see #2

Basically, we are not going to be jerks due to problems with enrollment, Internet outages, or Virtual Box installations.  At least for lab 1; for lab 2, all bets are off.
