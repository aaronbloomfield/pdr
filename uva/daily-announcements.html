## Regrades
- You can submit a regrade request if we mis-graded your exam
  - Submission is through Gradescope
- You need to expalin clearly (and BRIEFLY) why your answer should get more credit
- Did you lose points because your exam was hard to read?
    - The scanner had some issues with exam writing that wasn't dark enough
    - Please type up what you wrote in the exam regrade, and we'll regrade it without penalty
	- If you can't read it either, we'll look up the paper exam
- If you submit regrades that do not get points back, we reserve the right to LOWER your overall exam grade
    - We are trying to prevent frivolous regrades, and to prevent everybody from having us regrade their entire exam when it was graded properly the first time
- Regrades open today (Frdiay, 10/1) at 3pm, and close about 10 days later (Monday, 10/11) at the end of the day
    - Regrades will not be accepted outside that time window
