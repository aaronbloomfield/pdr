## Lab 9 information
- Office hours tonight (Monday, Apr 8th) are cancelled for obvious reasons
  - We are aiming to have the Monday TAs attend Wednesday's office hours for extra staffing
- Everybody has a 2 day extension on pre-lab and in-lab 9
  - So pre-lab 9 is due by Thursday morning at 8 a.m.
  - In-lab 9 is due by the end of the day on Thursday
- For the post-lab, we are currently thinking we will give a 1 day extension, but full details on Wednesday
- Regardless of the status of post-lab 9, pre-lab 10's due date won't be extended :-(

  - As of last night, 33 total lab spots were available
- No new spots will be created unless all the lab sections completely fill up
- So if you need to get into the class, you will have to choose the 9 am lecture and one of those two lab sections...
- If you register late, please submit a support request when you are able to, and we will give you an extension on the parts of lab 1
  - It may take a day or two for you to be able to use the course tools
