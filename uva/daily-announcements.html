## Course registration issues
- Current enrollment this morning was 75 with 15 on the wait list
- The room capacity is 90
- I had the course cap increased to 90, so everybody on the wait list should be able to enroll
- This should close out the registration issues
- I will give all of those people extensions on prelab 1 and inlab 1 until Friday at 10am
  - However, I can't do that until you are in the course roster
  - So please submit a support request
  - It's fine if this takes a few days to resolve itself
