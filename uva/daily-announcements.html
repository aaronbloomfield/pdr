## Online lab & office hours procedure
- All are held virtually (of course)
- OP are 5pm - 11pm on Sun, Mon, Wed, and Thu, and your lab section is on Tuesday
- Students should enter themselves into the [office hours queue](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php)
    - It's not yet configured, but will be by Sunday evening
	- There will be a 'how to contact you' box that you have to fill in
- You can opt to have help via:
    - Slack (via a private message chat): enter your Slack username in the 'how to contact you' box
		- To join the Slack workspace, see the links on the Collab landing page
    - Zoom (a video conference): enter your *personal meeting room ID link* in the 'how to contact you' box
	    - To find your personal meeting room link, go to https://zoom.us, and log in via 'sign in with SSO'; enter 'virginia' as the company domain box, and you will be redirected to Netbadge to log in.  Click on the 'personal room' tab, and the link will be displayed there -- it will be of the form https://virginia.zoom.us/j/1234567890
		- You then have to start that meeting so that, when the TAs connect, they can chat with you
- Please have patience
    - We *think* we have sufficient staffing for all the office hours and labs, but if we don't we'll reconfigure -- but that likely won't be able to happen that day
	- Because a lot of people wait until the last minute to start the lab parts, the waits will be quite long on Monday nights and Thursday nights
