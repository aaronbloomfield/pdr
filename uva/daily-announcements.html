## Halloween, arrrrrr!
- Office hours are all listed on the [Google calendar](https://t.co/9kRXZnqkxZ)
- [Lab 8: assembly, part 1](../labs/lab08-64bit/index.html) and tutorial 8 is out
  - We have some updated readings: new 64-bit x86 book chapters on [x86](../book/x86-64bit-asm-chapter.pdf) and the [C calling convention](../book/x86-64bit-ccc-chapter.pdf) as the reading
  - We realize that the [x86-64 Machine-Level Programming document](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15213-s07/misc/asm64-handout.pdf) from CMU used a different assembly format
- Grading: we are all caught up!
  - Grades through lab [5](../labs/lab05/index.html) have been returned
  - We've promptly fallen behind again with lab 6, however...
- Next week is the second midterm.  Yay!
  - Likely a review session on Sunday evening...
- If you didn't sign the [UNIX honor pledge](unix-honor-pledge-f16.pdf), we emailed you last night
- Lecture recordings are posted online on the [uva/index.html](index.html) file in the repo
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/directtool/5cb9faf8-a234-47f1-b29a-4698cf245b48/)!  It's through Collab, and feeling very lonely.
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- Today we will continue with [64 bit assembly](../slides/08-assembly-64bit.html#/), which will take us into Wednesday
  - As we are switching over to 64 bit assembly, a few links and what-not are broken in the repo; but most should work at this point

I have started on [Lab 6](../labs/lab06/index.html) (hashes), and I think:

1. It's easy!
2. It's hard, but doable
3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?

## Friday, September 23rd
- Office hours are all listed on the [Google calendar](https://t.co/9kRXZnqkxZ)

  - It's in lab, during your normal lab time

  - The midterm procedure, including the bubble footer, is described on the next->next slide
- Grading
  - Grades for labs [1](../labs/lab01/index.html) and [2](../labs/lab02/index.html) were returned last night
  - You have 10 days (from when they were returned) to submit a [regrade](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/regrades.php)
  - We'll go over the regrades today
  - We hope to have lab 3 returned on Monday; at that point, we'll be caught up again
- The plasmashell crash seems to have been solved!
  - The reason was the tooltip previews of open applications.  To disable them: right click taskbar -> Task Manager Settings -> General -> Uncheck "show tooltips"
- If you didn't sign the [UNIX honor pledge](unix-honor-pledge-f16.pdf) in lab yesterday, then our people will get in touch with your people...

## Midterm 1 topic coverage
- All slide sets through [numbers](../../slides/03-numbers.html#/)
  - This includes all that was taught in lecture
- For the [arrays & bigoh](../../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/) slide set:
  - The [arrays section](../../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/arrays) is fair game
  - The [orders of growth section](../../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/growth) will be covered at a very light level (meaning: you should be able to state the run-time of various algorithms we studied -- which has already been covered -- but we won't ask you to do big-Oh proofs)
  - The [determining running times section](../../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html#/arrays) is a reinforcement and review of determining the running times of things, so that's fair game as well
- All the material covered in the labs and tutorials
- Note that we often purposefully put in new content (a new data strucure, etc.) that you have never seen to see how you adapt what you have learned to that...
- See the [old exams](../../exams/index.html) in the repo!
  - Note that we do not post solutions to the old exams
  - And the TAs will not answer 'what is the answer to this' postings on Piazza
  - But you can always come to office hours!

	  <section id="midterm" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Midterm procedure
- This is the procedure for both midterms this semester
- It is taken during your normal lab section
- The first rule of 2150 midterm is that you don't speak about 2150 midterm
  - Translation: it is an honor violation to speak about it to somebody who has not taken it yet
- You have to fill out the [bubble footer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/images/exam-footer.jpg) at the bottom of the first page of the exam
  - And put your name and UVa userid at the top of each page
  - And sign the honor pledge
- There is typically a review session, likely the evening of the Sunday prior
- We hope to have it graded later that week (Thursday evening is our grading party)
  - Its completion will generate the second (of five!) course-wide emails
- There will not be office hours the Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of a midterm week
- Obviously, no lab is released at the end of the week prior to the midterm
  - But one will be released the week *of* a midterm for the following week
- Many questions will have a "word limit"...

- How did [lab 2](../labs/lab02/index.html) go?

  - Which means next Monday for [lab 1](../labs/lab01/index.html), although I expect that lab 1 will be delayed
- [Lab 3](../labs/lab03/index.html) and [tutorial 3: UNIX, part 1](../tutorials/03-04-more-unix/index.html) (introduction and sections 1-4) are out
- I am working on the Plasma crash issue in the VirtualBox image
  - We have a suspect that is causing it!
- Lecture recordings are posted online on the [uva/index.html](index.html) file in the repo
- [Anonymous feedback](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/directtool/5cb9faf8-a234-47f1-b29a-4698cf245b48/)!  It's through Collab, and feeling very lonely.
- [Readings](../docs/readings.html) are optional, and are posted in the git repo
- Today we will continue with [lists](../slides/02-lists.html#/), which will take us into early next week

3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.
