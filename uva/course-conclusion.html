## Course Objectives

<div style="font-size:67%">
<ul>
<li>Understand program representation from the high-level programming language perspective down to the underlying machine level representation, including: number representation, operations, conditionals, and control structures</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic and advanced abstract data types in C++ including: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs</li>
<li>Be able to evaluate asymptotic time and space complexity analysis of programs and data structure implementations using Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation and assess the suitability of a data structure for a particular problem</li>
<li>Understand the basic program execution model and the underlying computer hardware and software (fetch-execute cycle, memory hierarchy, operating system, compiler)</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic program control and data structures in an assembly language (loops, conditionals, subroutines and parameter passing modes, arrays)</li>
</div>

## What was new this semester
- Many tweaks and updates to the [github repo](https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr)
- A somewhat reasonable amount of TA resources
  - But still less than we would like it to be
- The second largest enrollments ever (403 students)
- Streamlined grading, which didn't run into too many delays
- Three instructors meant synchronizing the lectures more carefully
	</script></section>

## What didn't work well
- Some minor submission server issues
- Occassionally falling behind with the grading, but we caught up both times
- Not having as many readings available as we would have liked
- VirtualBox caused some issues for some people

## CS 2150 Enrollment Graph
![enrollment graph](enrollment.svg)
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What did work well
- The submission and gradebook scripts
  - Especially the support ticket system, even if we were occassionally slow to respond
- An excellent group of undergraduate TAs
- None of the labs had any major issues!  W00t!
  - (labs 6 & 10 do not count as "major issues")
- Use of the [github repo](https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr), and almost no use of Collab
- Behind-the-scenes stuff: TA management, organization, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Did we push too hard?
- We got as many "things are going great" comments as "things are going terrible"
- Part of the issues were the hard labs
- This course is meant to be a lot of work: a gateway into the CS electives
- The goal is to make you work efficiently, not necessarily more
- In hindsight, considering how much you accomplished this semester, was it still too much work?
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Changes for next semester
- It's all being taught by Professor Bloomfield
  - But Professors Floryan and Nguyen have graciouslly voluntered to help with the grading!
- Updates to the content in the [github repo](https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr) (some of which is listed in the [github repo issues](https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr/issues))
- Possibly a new submission system
- With the office hour queue data, we can better target where to staff extra TAs for the busiest office hours
- Course content changes (next slide)
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CS 2150 moving forward
- This course is (eventually) going to be replaced in a big curriculum change
  - The content will move into DSA2 and COA1
  - But that's still a few semesters off at this point
- Spring 2019 changes
  - One instructor means a different distribution of work
  - We may introduce set data structures
