## Course Objectives

<div style="font-size:80%">
<ul>
<li>Understand program representation from the high-level programming language perspective down to the underlying machine level representation, including: number representation, operations, conditionals, and control structures</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic and advanced abstract data types in C++ including: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs</li>
<li>Be able to evaluate asymptotic time and space complexity analysis of programs and data structure implementations using Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation and assess the suitability of a data structure for a particular problem</li>
<li>Understand the basic program execution model and the underlying computer hardware and software (fetch-execute cycle, memory hierarchy, operating system, compiler)</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic program control and data structures in an assembly language (loops, conditionals, subroutines and parameter passing modes, arrays)</li>
</div>

## What was new this semester
- Many tweaks and updates to the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr)
- A (somewhat) reasonable amount of TA resources
- The largest enrollment ever (249 students)
  - Due to this, I purposely didn't make many major changes to the course
- Streamlined grading, even if we did run into hitches and delays

## What didn't work well
- Falling behind in the grading, although we did periodically catch up
- Support request response slowness
- Still a somewhat small course staff due to lack of departmental $$$
- Not having as many readings available as I would have liked
- VirtualBox caused a lot of issues for some people

## What did work well
- Submission and gradebook scripts!  This saved a HUGE amount of TA time, and streamlined submission and grading
  - Especially the support ticket system
- A (relatively) large number of TAs along with an excellent group of TAs
- None of the labs had any major issues!  W00t!
  - Labs 6 & 10 do not count as "major issues"
- Use of the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr), and almost no use of Collab
- Behind-the-scenes stuff: TA management, organization, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Did I push too hard?
- I got as many "things are going great" comments as "things are going terrible"
  - Although anonymous feedback was rather lonely this semester...
- Part of the issues were the hard labs
- This course is meant to be a lot of work: a gateway into the CS electives
- The goal is to make you work efficiently, not necessarily more
- In hindsight, considering how much you accomplished this semester, was it still too much work?
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Changes for next semester
- More students than ever (likely at capacity of 270)
- A second lecture instructor!!!
- Updates to the content in the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr) (specifically what's listed in the [github repo issues](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/pdr/issues))
- With the data recorded from the office hours queue, we can better target where to staff extra TAs for the busiest office hours
- More book chapters; we only had a few this semester; I'd like to expand on the x86 one for next semester, and add a heap/Huffman chapter
- VirtualBox is showing it's age, and may be replaced
- Likewise, 32-bit x86 is showing it's age, and may change to 64-bit
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CS 2150 moving forward
- This course is scheduled to get a major overhaul for the fall 2016 semester
  - CS 1 (1110, 1111, 1112, 1113, etc.) got an overhaul for fall 2015 (this semester)
  - CS 2 (2110) is scheduled to get an overhaul for spring 2016 (next semester)
- Some of the course content may change, although I still think it will keep a "low-level" approach
  - And I suspect that it will still keep C++
- We may add parallel programming, although that would mean moving something (machine language? x86?) out of the course
