\noindent {\huge Unix Honor Pledge for CS 2150, (semester)}

\vspace{0.5in}

\noindent On my honor as a student at the University of Virginia, I
agree, unless specifically given permission otherwise:

\begin{itemize}

\item To not use any integrated development environment (IDE) for the
  development of C++ or assembly programs for the work for this
  course. These include, but are not limited to, such development
  environments such as Eclipse, Netbeans, Xcode, Geany, Visual Studio,
  Atom, etc.  The Sublime editor is allowed, provided it is used
  without extensions for build automation, debugging, or code
  completion; it shouldn't be any more powerful than a text editor
  like Emacs.
\begin{itemize}

\item This applies to IDEs on any platform, such as Microsoft Windows,
  Mac OS X, Unix, etc.

\end{itemize}

\item To develop my course programming work on Unix or Unix-like
  system. These systems include Linux (any variant), FreeBSD, Solaris,
  Unix systems installed on a virtual machine running on another OS
  (such as Windows or Mac OS X), remote Unix systems, and others as
  discussed in lecture.

\begin{itemize}

\item IDEs cannot be used in such systems, however, as that defeats
  the purpose.

\item Mac OS X is allowed as long as the Unix-based features are used,
  and IDEs are not used.

\item The Windows 10 Bash shell is allowed, but you are on your own on
  this one~-- and you still can't use Windows IDEs or Windows-based
  editors.

\end{itemize}

\item If there is any doubt about the applicability of this pledge, I
  will ask before assuming.

\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent Failure to abide by this agreement will mean an immediate
failure for the course, and the raising of honor charges.
