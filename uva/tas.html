I am Sam Spelsberg, third year in e-school CS, with a focus in Cyber Security. 2150 is one of my favorite classes in the CS major, and I believe that the concepts I learned in this class have been foundational to the rest of my computer science experience. I now strive to help other students learn, and get as much as possible from this course.<p>
I love traveling, and experiencing other cultures, and I hope to travel to each continent some day. I was born in Seattle and I will always love the west coast. Social Psychology is my favorite course I've taken outside of the engineering school, and I find the studies of human behavior, philosophy, ethics, and history fascinating.<p>
Hit me up if you ever have any questions about cyber security!
