<p><a href="//libra.cs.virginia.edu/tas/full/rsb4zm.jpg"><img src="//libra.cs.virginia.edu/tas/rsb4zm.jpg" alt="Ramya Bhaskara" /></a> I’m a second year Computer Science major and this is my first semester TAing this class! I’m really interested in data science, cooking/eating, and art. I’m also a part of SWE, A.O.E., and WiCS. I’m a TA because it can be really rewarding, and I loved CS 2150 as a student. <br clear="all"></p>

<p><a href="//libra.cs.virginia.edu/tas/full/atc4yk.jpg"><img src="//libra.cs.virginia.edu/tas/atc4yk.jpg" alt="Anna Cuddeback" /></a> Hey Friends! My name is Anna Cuddeback and I’m a second year from Medford, Massachusetts studying computer engineering and physics. Outside of TAing and classes, I do physics research, resident-advise a first year dorm, and an officer in Outdoors at UVa. I’m really into my chacos, and my diet primarily subsets of peanut butter Clif bars and Dunkin Donuts iced coffee. I am also emotionally attached to my Nalgene. If you’re not sure where I am, you can probably find me climbing at Slaughter or scooping up deals at the local Goodwill. Like Dwight Schrute, I always keep an extra set of Birkenstocks in the car for special occasions. <br clear="all"></p>

<p>
I love traveling, and experiencing other cultures, and I hope to travel to each continent some day. I was born in Seattle and I will always love the west coast. Social Psychology is my favorite course I’ve taken outside of the engineering school, and I find the studies of human behavior, philosophy, ethics, and history fascinating.

Hiyo! I'm a third-year CS Major from McLean, VA. This is my first semester TAing for 2150. I started TAing for the course because of how much I loved this course when I took it and of course because of how much I love Professor Aaron Bloomfield. He is THE MAN and a CS GOD. (Professor Nguyen and Floryan are also amazing!!) Outside of doing CS and living in Thornton Stacks, I'm an active member of VSA (Vietnamese Student Association). I have too many hobbies at the moment: I play lots of volleyball, basketball, and I have recently gotten into climbing at Slaughter. You'll catch me a lot in Mem gym or the AFC because I also like to dance with the Hooligans club. If you're ever looking to play volleyball or interested in dancing, I'm your guy!

Hi, I'm a fourth year CS (BS) and Econ major with a Engineering Business minor. This is my 3rd semester TAing for 2150 and before that I was a TA for 1110. I got interested in programming to automate simple tasks such as alerting me when people get on the 2150 queue or getting basketball tickets to UVA games.<p>Outside of school I like to stay active (running, tennis, basketball, pretty much anything). Sadly, I also waste a lot of time playing video games (mostly PUBG and CSGO).
