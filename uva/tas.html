alt="Samuel Ahn" /></a> Hey! I’m Samuel Ahn, and I’m a third year in the
engineering school majoring in CS. I play cello as a hobby, play chess
for fun, and my favorite drink is coffee!</p>
<p>Although I found it a bit hard at first, 2150 ended up being the most
informative and fun CS class that I have taken so far, and I am happy to
be a TA again this semester for its final iteration. I’ll do my best to
do what my TAs did for me and make it easier to learn the contents of
the class. I look forward to meeting you guys this semester!

year CS major in the College. This is my second semester TAing 2150.
When I took this course I probably attended OH more than 100 times, so
I’m excited to help you all the same way other TA’s helped me! When I’m
not in office hours, I’m either participating in WiCS &amp; GWC here on
grounds or reading conspiracy theories and visiting new coffee shops.
Really looking forward to meeting you guys this semester :)

call me Tiki, and this is my first semester as a TA for CS 2150! I am a
third year BACS major from NOVA, and I’m ready to help you all in any
way I can. At UVA, I am involved with Madison House Tutoring and Girls
Hoo Code, and in my free time I enjoy playing volleyball, reading, and
watching movies with friends. I can’t wait to see you all in person this
semester, and good luck in 2150!! <br clear='all'></p>

I’m a second-year majoring in Computer Science and Archaeology,
interested in some of the overlap there. This is my first semester TAing
and am excited to meet all of you! I enjoy a hodgepodge of things, but
am active in the Student Game Developers Club, UVA Survivor, the No
Tones (bad) acapella group, lifting, and watching UVA sports. I really
enjoyed this class and learned so much, and hope you will too!

year in the College of Arts and Sciences studying Computer Science and
Economics with a minor in global sustainability. This is my second
semester teaching this class and I’m super excited about it. In my free
time, I love to go on runs and spend time with my friends watching
whatever our new show obsession is that time. I can’t wait to meet all
of you! <br clear='all'></p>

alt="Lucy Wang" /></a> Hello! I’m Lucy, and I am a third year CS and
statistics major from NOVA. 2150 has been my favorite class I have taken
so far, and although it may be stressful and challenging at times, all
of the work was very well worth the effort and I promise you will make
it through and think the same :)
<p>
Outside of class, I enjoy playing volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and
going on walks/runs. I love cafes/bakeries and I would (ideally) like to
open my own bakery one day! My favorite pastries are donuts and cinnamon
rolls so let me know if you have any (easy) recipes!
<p>
<p>I am excited to work with you all this semester and feel free to
reach out if you have any question! <br clear='all'></p>

alt="Zach Yahn" /></a> Hi everyone! I’m a third-year CS/CpE double
major. I knew I wanted to TA CS 2150 the moment I was inspired by
Binky’s Pointer Fun, and I guess I really like helping people too.
<p>
<p>I play club water polo here for fun, so if you’re ever looking for a
new activity to try let me know! My favorite movie is Inception, and my
favorite jelly bean flavor is anything but buttered popcorn. I’m excited
to work with you all and hope you have a great semester!
