2150</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the CS 2150 page</a> (<a
href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>Some students will have SDAC (<a
href="https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/SDAC">Student Disabilities
Access Center</a>) accommodations. Below is how we handle these
accommodations in this course. Obviously, only the accommodations
determined by SDAC apply to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extra time on exams:</strong> the midterms are taken during
your lab slot. When your regular lab time is over, just put your pen
down, tell the TA that you have extended time, and you can start up
again when the next lab section starts – this means you will have a 15
minute break in the middle. For semesters with only one lab, you should
put your pen down when stated, and when a TA comes to pick up your exam,
tell him or her that you have SDAC extended time. Note that you are also
welcome to take it at SDAC. For the final exam, you will also get the
extra time – but note that the final exam will start at the same time,
and will go late.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced distraction environment for exams:</strong> please
arrange to take it at the SDAC center, and we will submit the exam to
them in time. The dates of the exams – midterms and final – are on the
course syllabus.</li>
<li><strong>Permission to type during an exam:</strong> if this applies
to you, we should have a chat about it. This is a very rare
accommodation.</li>
<li><strong>Permission to use a calculator on an exam:</strong> if this
applies to you, we should have a chat about it. This is a very rare
accommodation. And note that the exams are specifically designed to not
require any arithmetic that would require a calculator.</li>
<li><strong>Permission to use a computer to either type or use other
assistive technology:</strong> during lecture or lab, that’s totally
fine. Anybody is welcome to use a computer (or similar) during lecture
or lab. If this will apply during an exam, have a chat with us, as we
don’t want the TAs to think you are cheating on an exam because of
this.</li>
<li><strong>Computerized and printed copy of an exam:</strong> Please
arrange to take the exam at SDAC, and they will be able to provide you
with both the printed copy and PDF copy, as necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced copies of lecture recordings:</strong> all the
lectures for the entire semester are available in the git repo (we’ll
see the git repo on the first day of class), so you can see all the
lectures on day 1. The recordings are made during the lecture time
itself, so it is not possible to get those early.</li>
<li><strong>Reasonable modification of assignment deadlines:</strong> if
you need such an extension on a lab part, then just submit a support
request asking for more time. Be sure to state that this is part of your
SDAC accommodations in that support request. The only concern is that we
don’t want one lab part to be so late that it causes future ones to also
be late – but if this becomes an issue, we can discuss your particular
case. Note that this accommodation does not apply to exams.</li>
<li><strong>Permission to record classes or access class
recordings:</strong> We record – and post – all the lectures, so this
accommodation does not apply to this class.</li>
<li><strong>Typing essay portions of exams:</strong> we do not have
essay portions on our exams, so this accommodation does not apply.</li>
<li><strong>Note-taking:</strong> historically students have not wanted
this particular accommodation, as the course structure provides a
limited form of notes via the slides, and due to the recordings of the
lectures and lecture sessions. If this accommodation applies to you, and
you want it, please let me know.</li>
<li><strong>Classroom breaks:</strong> anybody is free to take whatever
breaks they feel they need during lecture or lab.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to take breaks during an exam:</strong> no problem.
Let the TAs know about this, and that it’s an SDAC accommodations. This
typically comes with extra time as well.</li>
<li><strong>Access to cell phone for medical purposes:</strong> no
problem. If this is during an exam, let the TAs know why you are using
your cell phone. But if it is a medical emergency, we can do the
explanations afterward.</li>
<li><strong>Final exam reschedule:</strong> please let me know if the
first month of classes if you need to take the final exam at a different
time. You can do this via a support request. You cannot take the exam
early, but can take it late.</li>
<li><strong>One exam per day:</strong> similar to the previous one,
please let me know if the first month of classes if you need to take the
final exam at a different time. You cannot take the exam early, but can
take it late.</li>
<li><strong>Reasonable modification of course attendance
policy:</strong> we do not require attendance in either lab or lecture,
so this does not apply. If this occurs during an exam, let us know as
soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
