Program and Data Representation: Gradescope FAQ</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the CS 2150 page</a> (<a
href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>Below are a number of common questions – and their answers – that
students often have when dealing with Gradescope. Feel free to suggest
more! Especially if there was a problem you ran into that you think
others would also run into.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-my-lab-grade--10-even-after-the-submission-deadline">Why
is my lab grade ‘-/10’ even after the submission deadline?</h3>
<p>We have set Gradescope to only display your grade <strong>after we
publish them</strong>. This means that your grade will not be known for
an assignment until the professors choose to release them. This is
primarily so we can identify any grading issues and resolve them before
releasing your grades.</p>
<h3
id="if-i-passed-all-the-public-test-on-gradescope-will-i-get-a-1010">If
I passed all the public test on Gradescope, will I get a 10/10?</h3>
<p>No. There are many hidden test cases that are not shown to you until
<strong>after</strong> we publish the scores.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-times-can-i-submit-my-lab-to-gradescope">How many times
can I submit my lab to Gradescope?</h3>
<p>As many times as you like.</p>
<h3
id="i-want-to-request-a-regrade-but-the-button-is-grayed-out.-what-do-i-do">I
want to request a regrade, but the button is grayed out. What do I
do?</h3>
<p>Only submit a regrade request if you are absolutely certain that
there is an issue on our end with grading. Regrades can be made through
support requests under course tools on the collab page.</p>
<h3
id="my-program-is-failing-on-gradescope-but-works-on-my-machine-why">My
program is failing on Gradescope but works on my machine, why?</h3>
<p>There are a lot of reasons this could be happening. The first thing
you should check is if your main method is returning 0 or 1 at the end
of the program. Non-zero return codes indicate that an error occurred in
the executable, so if you’re returning 1 in your main method, return 0
instead (you must return 0 if you want the auto-grader to work).</p>
<p>If that wasn’t the problem, then it could be a discrepancy between
the compilers on your computer and on Gradescope. This occurs most often
for Mac users, as Apple Clang is far more forgiving than the Linux Clang
Gradescope uses. In these cases, the best option to identify the error
is to use the VM provided to you for this class. We will always use
Gradescope’s results to grade your program, and this will typically not
be a valid reason to request a regrade, as you can always use the VM to
figure out what is wrong.</p>
<h3
id="how-do-i-read-the-diff-output-on-some-of-the-gradescope-test-cases">How
do I read the “diff” output on some of the Gradescope test cases?</h3>
<p>When we run your program in some Gradescope tests, we save your
output to a file and compare that with the expected output. We then use
the <code>diff</code> command to print out the difference between your
output and what’s expected. <a
href="https://www.computerhope.com/unix/udiff.htm">This web page</a>
does a good job of explaining how to read the diff output. It takes some
time to get the hang of, but it is the best way to quickly see where
your output is incorrect.</p>
<h3
id="is-gradescope-sensitive-to-white-space-like-spaces-tabs-newlines-etc.">Is
Gradescope sensitive to white space like spaces, tabs, newlines,
etc.?</h3>
<p>Gradescope is not sensitive to spaces or tabs, but is sensitive to
newlines. So an extra newline in your output may cause a test case to
fail, but an extra space will not. This means that sometimes your output
will look exactly like what we expect, but all you need to do is either
add or remove a newline to get the credit.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-go-if-gradescope-fails-to-run-my-code">Where to go if
Gradescope fails to run my code?</h3>
<p>If you see a message saying that the auto-grader failed to run or to
contact course staff, just make a post on piazza so we can help you.
Emailing or submitting support requests will not typically be responded
to fast enough.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-my-programs-keep-getting-timed-out-on-gradescope">Why do
my programs keep getting timed out on Gradescope?</h3>
<p>With the exception of a few labs – those that we indicate in the lab
document that you need to optimize – we set the timeouts to be much
longer than necessary. If your program is timing out, you most likely
have an infinite loop or are waiting for some input that you shouldn’t
be. If you’re working on lab 6 or some other time-critical lab, start
optimizing your code.</p>
<h3
id="why-cant-gradescope-find-my-makefile-or-compile-my-code-correctly">Why
cant Gradescope find my Makefile or compile my code correctly?</h3>
<p>Firstly, make sure your Makefile is called <code>Makefile</code>
(note the case!) so the make command can properly run. Also make sure
your compilation line doesn’t rename your executable from a.out to
something else. Unless we explicitly tell you to rename your executable,
don’t do it.</p>
