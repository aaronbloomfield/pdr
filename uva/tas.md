Hey! I'm Samuel Ahn, and I'm a third year in the engineering school majoring in CS. I play cello as a hobby, play chess for fun, and my favorite drink is coffee! 

Although I found it a bit hard at first, 2150 ended up being the most informative and fun CS class that I have taken so far, and I am happy to be a TA again this semester for its final iteration. I'll do my best to do what my TAs did for me and make it easier to learn the contents of the class. I look forward to meeting you guys this semester!

Hi guys! My name is Ayushi and I’m a third year CS major in the College. This is my second semester TAing 2150. When I took this course I probably attended OH more than 100 times, so I’m excited to help you all the same way other TA’s helped me! When I’m not in office hours, I’m either participating in WiCS & GWC here on grounds or reading conspiracy theories and visiting new coffee shops. Really looking forward to meeting you guys this semester :)

What's up everyone? I'm Spencer Portuese, I'm a second-year majoring in Computer Science and Archaeology, interested in some of the overlap there. This is my first semester TAing and am excited to meet all of you! I enjoy a hodgepodge of things, but am active in the Student Game Developers Club, UVA Survivor, the No Tones (bad) acapella group, lifting, and watching UVA sports. I really enjoyed this class and learned so much, and hope you will too!

Hello! I'm Lucy, and I am a third year CS and statistics major from NOVA. 2150 has been my favorite class I have taken so far, and although it may be stressful and challenging at times, all of the work was very well worth the effort and I promise you will make it through and think the same  :) <p>Outside of class, I enjoy playing volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and going on walks/runs. I love cafes/bakeries and I would (ideally) like to open my own bakery one day! My favorite pastries are donuts and cinnamon rolls so let me know if you have any (easy) recipes!<p>I am excited to work with you all this semester and feel free to reach out if you have any question!

Hi everyone! I'm a third-year CS/CpE double major. I knew I wanted to TA CS 2150 the moment I was inspired by Binky's Pointer Fun, and I guess I really like helping people too.<p>I play club water polo here for fun, so if you're ever looking for a new activity to try let me know! My favorite movie is Inception, and my favorite jelly bean flavor is anything but buttered popcorn. I'm excited to work with you all and hope you have a great semester!
