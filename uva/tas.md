Hey Friends! My name is Anna Cuddeback and I'm a second year from Medford, Massachusetts studying computer engineering and physics. Outside of TAing and classes, I do physics research, resident-advise a first year dorm, and an officer in Outdoors at UVa. I'm really into my chacos, and my diet primarily subsets of peanut butter Clif bars and Dunkin Donuts iced coffee. I am also emotionally attached to my Nalgene. If you're not sure where I am, you can probably find me climbing at Slaughter or scooping up deals at the local Goodwill. Like Dwight Schrute, I always keep an extra set of Birkenstocks in the car for special occasions.

Hiyo! I'm a third-year CS Major from McLean, VA. This is my first semester TAing for 2150. I started TAing for the course because of how much I loved this course when I took it and of course because of how much I love Professor Aaron Bloomfield. He is THE MAN and a CS GOD. (Professor Nguyen and Floryan are also amazing!!) Outside of doing CS and living in Thornton Stacks, I'm an active member of VSA (Vietnamese Student Association). I have too many hobbies at the moment: I play lots of volleyball, basketball, and I have recently gotten into climbing at Slaughter. You'll catch me a lot in Mem gym or the AFC because I also like to dance with the Hooligans club. If you're ever looking to play volleyball or interested in dancing, I'm your guy!

Hi, I'm a fourth year CS (BS) and Econ major with a Engineering Business minor. This is my 3rd semester TAing for 2150 and before that I was a TA for 1110. I got interested in programming to automate simple tasks such as alerting me when people get on the 2150 queue or getting basketball tickets to UVA games.<p>Outside of school I like to stay active (running, tennis, basketball, pretty much anything). Sadly, I also waste a lot of time playing video games (mostly PUBG and CSGO).

Hi everyone! I'm Steven Yi, a third-year CS major in the engineering school. I became a TA because I really enjoyed taking this course and really like helping explain CS concepts to people. Outside of CS, I am also heavily involved in the music department (I almost always have a concert coming up‚Ä¶tickets are free üòä) and participate in UVA's Aero Design Team, where we design, build, and fly remote-control aircraft. In my free time, you can often find me playing my violin at Old Cabell, or climbing at Slaughter if I'm feeling athletic.<p>Fun fact: I love carrying fruit snacks in my backpack, and usually carry a handful of packs with me.

Hi everyone! I am currently a 4th year Computer Engineering and Math double major. This is my 3rd semester TAing for this class. CS 2150 was honestly one of my favorite courses at UVa, so I hope I can help make the course just as enjoyable for all of you! Other than TAing, I also work as a research assistant and recently joined CSO. Fun fact about me is that I went axe throwing for the first time this last summer. I also have a pet cat at home!

I am Sam Spelsberg, third year in e-school CS, with a focus in Cyber Security. 2150 is one of my favorite classes in the CS major, and I believe that the concepts I learned in this class have been foundational to the rest of my computer science experience. I now strive to help other students learn, and get as much as possible from this course.<p>
I love traveling, and experiencing other cultures, and I hope to travel to each continent some day. I was born in Seattle and I will always love the west coast. Social Psychology is my favorite course I've taken outside of the engineering school, and I find the studies of human behavior, philosophy, ethics, and history fascinating.<p>
Hit me up if you ever have any questions about cyber security!
