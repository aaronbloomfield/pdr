<p>All assignments will be submitted through our custom assignments tool, which can be accessed through Collab. Each assignment has 3 dates: an open date (when you can start submitting the assignment), a due date (when it is due), and a close date (the last point that you can submit the assignment). The dates are listed for the week of the lab; the lab week starts on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday. In particular, the due date for the pre-labs, as well as the open date for both the in-labs and post-labs, is when the first Tuesday lab section starts. The close date for the post-labs is the start of Friday's lecture (the first lecture, if there are multiple lecture periods).</p>
<p>Any late lab part will receive 25% off (for that lab part) for the first 24 hours (or part thereof) that it is late, after which no credit will be given. Note that a computer program does this deduction -- so if your lab is 1 second late, it still receives 25% off. Beyond 24 hours late, that lab part will receive zero credit.</p>
<p>A lab extension for an in-lab will extend the due date until the end of the day on Wednesday; lab extensions are discussed in <a href="../labs/lab01/index.html">Lab 1</a>. For the pre-labs and post-labs, the close date is exactly 24 hours after the due date, due to the above mentioned late policy.</p>
<p>Below are the dates when the various assignment <em>submissions</em> for the lab parts open, are due, and close.</p>
