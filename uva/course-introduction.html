## Instructional Staff
- Eight undergraduate TAs
    - You can read their bios and see their pictures at: https://uva-cs.github.io/pdr/uva/tas.html
    - That page may not be updated fully quite yet, but will be soon.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Collab
- We use it for only a few things:
  - Links to lecture recordings, Piazza, Gradescope, and various external tools
  - The email list and anonymous feedback
- Most everything else is external to Collab
  - Course tools: support requests, office hours queue
  - Slides, labs, and tutorials are in the [github repo](https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr) (more on this in a bit)
  - [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) for lab submission
- We'll see a tour of the Collab tools, and the github repo, in the next lecture
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Contacting Us
- Support requests (not yet ready); we will try to respond within 24 hours
- Questions posed through [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class)
  - Typically answered by other students or the TAs
- Office hours
  - Will start on Sunday in a week or so; we will expect to have about 24 per week
    - Will be posted on the Collab landing page
	  - TA office hours are in the evenings on Sun/Mon/Wed/Thu
    - Any changes will be announced in class or on Piazza.
- Anonymous feedback through Collab

## Contacting Us
<img class='stretch' alt='Who to contact' src='images/introduction/contacting-flowchart.png'>
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Please don't (well, try not to) email us
- It's not because we are trying to be jerks (really!)
- Email is not an efficient form of communication
  - We get bogged down in way too many emails, and then can't respond in a reasonable amount of time, which is not fair to you
- With lots of students and one instructor, we can't keep up
- You can always fill out support request -- that's what they are there for
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Contacting You
- The [daily announcements slide set](daily-announcements.html)
  - If you miss lecture, you are responsible for checking it!
- It is your responsiblity to check these two announcement locations on a regular basis
- Class email
  - We expect to send only 5 this entire semester
- Everything in this course happens on a very structured schedule, so there will be no surprises as to when things happen
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meetings
- Lectures: M/W/F from 1:00-1:50 in Olsson 018
- Lab meetings: 1 per week at your scheduled lab time (6:30 pm on Tuesdays in Olsson 018)
- Evening office hours, if you choose to attend them
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lectures
- Lecture attendance is NOT required
- They are recorded, and you can veiw the recordings on your own
- If you come to lecture, then you have to pay attention
    - Which means we are going to ask you to close your computers, cell phones, etc.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Snow days
- The schedule for the material this semester is rather tight, and we can withstand missing (maybe) one lecture due to unforeseen circumstances
  - We don't know if snow days will affect us this semester given the circumstances. We will deal with it and communicate with you if it comes up.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Expectations
- Prerequisites: (CS 2110 or CS 2220) and (CS 2102 or CS 2120), all with a C- or above
  - CS 2110 is a strict pre-req, and no expections will be made for this
- You understand basic programming (CS I & II):
  - Can write a program longer than a screen-full
  - Understand references, classes, objects, templates (generics)
  - Familiar with common control structures, procedures, recursive definitions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Expectations
- You remember some things from CS 2102 (or will learn/refresh your understanding when you need them):
  - Arithmetic, logarithms, sets, graphs
  - Proof techniques (induction, contradiction)
  - This material may be used in the context of a test question
	  </script></section>
	  
	  <section id="cs2102" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## CS 2102 (or CS 2120) as a co-req
- If you have not already taken CS 2102 previously, you may take it this semester; it is allowed as a co-req
    - But you can't wait until next semester to take it
- For the current semester, there may still be some spots available in CS 2120
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Labs / HWs
- Labs are much bigger in this course, and essentially are the homeworks
- Labs will officially be made available on Thursday by noon, and due throughout the following week
  - However, all labs are posted now and will likely incur only minor changes, if you'd like to get ahead.
  - Pre-lab to be done BEFORE showing up to Tuesday's lab section: all are due at the same time on Tuesday (8 am)
    - Often includes a tutorial
  - In-lab to be done IN lab section (due Tuesday 11:59 pm)
  - Post-lab to be done AFTER lab section (due Friday 10 am)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## More on Labs
- Labs begin next Tuesday (August 30th)
- Labs are officially "ready" on Thursdays at noon
  - Before then, lab updates are possible.
  - Which means the first one should be posted *this Thursday*
  - See [lab due dates page](./labduedates.html) for more info.
- There are late policies for the labs -- these are discussed in the first lab
- You can't change sections without prior permission (via a support request), as we don't have the TAs to support this
	  </script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lab attendance
- Lab attendance is not required, either
- However, it may be the only chance for you to receive help on the in-lab
  - Monday office hours will give priority to those working on the pre-lab
  - By Wednesday's office hours, the in-lab will be late and will be receiving a penalty
</script></section>

<section id="registration" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Should you be taking CS 2150?
- The course is ending; the new curriculum is taking over
- You should take this class ONLY if ALL of the these are true:
  - You are a currently declared computing major
    - Not-yet-declared students should take the new curriculum
  - You are NOT a CS minor
    - CS minors will be able to take another path to complete the minor
  - You have a C- or above in CS 2110
    - If you have less than a C- in CS 2110, or you have taken CS 2100, then move to the new curriculum
  - You are NOT a first year student
    - They take the new curriculum
  - You are NOT a transfer student
    - They also take the new curriculum
</script></section>



<section id="registration" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Fall 2022 registration issues
- There should (eventually) be enough space
- We are going to wait for the registration count to settle...
  - Including those who drop from the previous slide
- We'll look at it briefly on Friday, but really get back to it on Monday
</script></section>
	  <!--
	  <section id="labswaps" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lab and Lecture Swaps
- You are welcome to swap labs (or lectures) with somebody else, or switch into a lab that has free spots
- To switch to an open lab, do a lab section swap in SIS
  - If you attempt to drop and then re-add the course, you will go to the END of the wait list, and then you will not be allowed back into the course!
  - And make sure there is room in the destination lab before you try this!!!
- To swap with somebody:
  - Post on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class) to find somebody to switch with
    - If you are reading this before the semester starts, then wait until the first day of class to post...
	  </script></section>

	  <section id="labswaps2" data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lab and Lecture Swaps, part 2
- Once you have found somebody, ask somebody in the main engineering office (in Thorton A122) *nicely* to swap the two of you
- Please understand that we do not have the ability to do any of these actions ourselves
	  </script></section>
-->
	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lab due times
- All the labs have a [specified due time](labduedates.html), as described in lab 1, and mentioned previously
  - The submission server has it's clock set to the [US Navy atomic clock](http://time.gov)
- If the lab is late for ANY reason, then you will receive the late penalty.  
- Thus, you should take this into account and not wait until the last minute to try to submit.  These reasons include:
  - Your Internet being slow (or down)
  - Your younger sibling messing up your submission
  - Your dog eating your homework
  - You missing the deadline by 1 minute, but pleeeaaaassseeeee!!!!!111oneoneONEONE
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lab submission - Gradescope
- We will be using [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com)
- ALL assignments are ***autograded;*** when you submit it, it will check:
  - If your code compiles
  - If your output format is correct
  - Execute and check output on 1 or 2 simple cases (likely the ones provided with the lab)
- It will then ***secretly*** run your code on several grading test cases
    - You won't see this part until the grade is fully released after the deadline has passed.
- You may submit as many times as you want before the deadline passes.
	  </script></section>
<!--
    <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Gradescope Disclaimer
- Every lab assignment this year is a fully auto-graded coding assignment 
    - We feel this works better with the virtual format and the class size
- [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) should make this easier, giving you more feedback than before
- However, please understand that there may be a few bumps, and we will address them as best we can when/if they arise

	  </script></section>
-->
	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Piazza
- [Piazza](https://piazza.com) is a useful newsgroup-like tool for collegiate courses
  - Students post questions, and other students or instructors can post answers
- When you log in (via Collab) for the first time, an account is created for you
  - If the e-mail settings default to "send annoying emails all the time", you can easily change this
  - In Piazza, in the upper-right, click on the gear/settings icon, select "Account/Email Settings", and then select "Edit Email Notifications" under "Class & Email Settings"
- Piazza posts are generally answered by the TAs and other students
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Piazza rules
- Don't post any code on it, period (that's an honor violation!)
- The TAs and instructors will specifically ***NOT*** respond to "what is the answer to this exam question" postings
- Note that you can post anonymously to each other, but the course instructional staff will know who you are
- If you start trolling other students on Piazza, I will permanently ban you from it -- please be respectful of your fellow students in the course
	  </script></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Accounts
- Your [Collab](http://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal) account, which you should already have
- Your [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com) account, which you can access via Collab
- Your [Piazza](https://piazza.com) account, which will be created when you log into Piazza via Collab
- You do *NOT* need a [github](https://github.com) account for this course (more on this shortly)
  - But feel free to create one!  It will be used heavily in successive courses.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="unixinfo"><script type="text/template">
## Unix Options
This class will program exclusively in a Unix environment.  There are a number of options to do so (listed from easy to hard):

- Run VirtualBox (it's free) and use the course Linux image
  - This is the recommended option; there will be extensive directions
  - This will be fine for slow (or non-existent) home Internet connections
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="unixinfo"><script type="text/template">
## More Unix Options
- Mac users can use a terminal window, as Mac OS X is based on Unix -- but you can't use an IDE!
  - Note that some things (such as doxygen and some x86 features) are not compatible!
- Install a Unix OS (Linux, etc.) on your home machine
  - Backup everything first!!!
- You can try the Windows 10 Bash shell, but you are on your own
  - In the past, students have found this works very well
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id='unixhonorpledge'><script type="text/template">
## Unix honor pledge

In order to take this class, you must agree to sign an honor pledge stating that you will not use any MS Windows development environment (including Visual Studio) for any work for this class.  If you do, it will be an honor violation, and you will receive an automatic F for the course. 
&nbsp;  
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Unix honor pledge

Furthermore, you cannot use any IDE (Xcode, Eclipse, Netbeans, Visual Studio, etc.) on any OS for the code development in this course. The Sublime editor is allowed, provided it is used without extensions for build automation, debugging, or code completion; it shouldn't be any more powerful than a text editor like Emacs.
&nbsp;  
(the reason for this is to teach you Unix, not a vendetta against IDEs)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Compiler usage
- We will be using clang++ (from LLVM), *not* g++
  - If you don't know what this means, you can safely ignore it
  - But if you are familiar with gcc/g++, please don't use it, as clang has MUCH better error messages
- (Note that we will use gcc/g++ for the two x86 labs, but more on that later)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Textbooks
- There are none for this course
  - The books that exist are way too expensive and not all that good
- Instead, we will have optional [online readings](../docs/readings.html) for those who would like to read about the course material as well
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course materials
- Most of the course materials can be found online; more on this shortly
- These slides are written using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/), a HTML-based presentation system
  - The source for the slides is in the github repo (more on this shortly)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Printing the slides
- To export to a PDF (and thus to print), you must use Google Chrome; see [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#pdf-export) for details on how to print
  - Don't worry about step 1 -- just add "?print-pdf" to the end of the URL: [course-introduction.html?print-pdf](course-introduction.html?print-pdf)
  - Or click on the printer icon (<a href="course-introduction.html?print-pdf"><img class="print" width="20" src="../slides/images/print-icon.png" style="vertical-align:middle"></a> ) on the title slide
  - This prints one slide per page
- Use a program to print 6 slides per page
  - We use [evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince/Downloads), but Acrobat can likely do this as well
  - In evince, set pages per side to 6, and scaling to 97%
- Note that the slides are not in a linear format, so printing may cause issues; you can always view the slides online
  - Click 'o' to see the non-linear layout of the slides; click 'o' or Escape to return
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## git repository
- git is a revision control system which is used to track changes to "stuff" (source code, slide sets, etc.)
  - It keeps them in "repositories" or "repos"
  - It also easily allows group work on a single code base, although we won't see that in this course
- Most of the course materials can be found online at http://github.com/uva-cs/pdr
  - The contents of that repo can be viewed online at: https://uva-cs.github.io/pdr
  - As mentioned previously, a few things are still in Collab
  - And the stuff specific to you (grades, submissions, etc.) are available through the set of online tools
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Not using git
- If you choose not to use git, then every time you want to download any updates to the course materials, you will have to go to http://github.com/uva-cs/pdr, re-download the *entire* .zip file, delete the old directory, and uncompress the newly downloaded file
  - As we are going to be updating the content in the repository throughout the semester, this will very quickly become a real pain to deal with
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Using git, part 1
- git is installed on the VirtualBox image (more on VirtualBox shortly)
- To use git, enter the following command only once (no github account needed!):
```
git clone https://github.com/uva-cs/pdr
```
  - This will create a 'pdr' directory that contains everything from the repo: the slides, the labs, the tutorials, etc.
  - Note that much of the content of this repository will be updated throughout the semester
  - This was already done on the provided VirtualBox image
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Using git, part 2
- To get the latest version, just change into that directory via the command line ("`cd pdr`"), and enter:
```
git pull
```
- If that runs into errors, you really need to get those fixed, otherwise you will not be using the latest version.
- That's it!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A warning about the git repo
- You will see future assignments (labs, mostly) in the git repo
- Feel free to look at these, but...
- We will be making many changes up until the time we officially "release" them to the class
  - This will be the Thursday (noon) the week before they are due
- If you start them early, then it is **YOUR** responsibility to figure out what changes have been made to the assignment between when you started it and when we finalized it
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course syllabus
- It is available in the github repo; you can click [here](../uva/syllabus.html) to view it
- It contains all the information covered so far, plus some more stuff
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Learning your names...
I am determined to learn each of your (first) names  
&nbsp;  
So if you raise your hand in lecture, and I don't call on you by name, you have to say your first name before your question  
&nbsp;  
Don't be offended if it takes me a while -- there are almost 100 students in this course...

# Honor Policy
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Class Honor Policy
The University of Virginia Honor Policy in effect.  In addition to the normal rules, we have additional rules (full details in the [course syllabus](syllabus.html)):

1. You may not look at the code of another student (past or present) for ANY reason
2. You may not try to hack my submission system
3. You may not discuss the midterm details to someone who has not already taken it
4. You may not release your source code online (including in a public github repo)
5. You may not use a computer to generate your submitted *assembly* code unless otherwise allowed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Class Honor Policy, continued
The University of Virginia Honor Policy in effect.  In addition to the normal rules, we have additional rules (full details in the [course syllabus](syllabus.html)):

6. We realize we shouldn't have to say this, but we will not sign more than one conscientious retraction for a given student within one semester.
7. We thought this was obvious also, but apparently we have to say it: you can't submit somebody else's code as the main part of the assignment and claim it is valid because you cited that code.  The point of the labs is for *you* to do the work, not for you to do a Google search.
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Class Honor Policy
Any honor violation or cheating will be referred to the honor committee, and will result in <strong class="red">immediate failure</strong> for the course  
&nbsp;  
We have done this before, and we will do it again.  Please don't test me on this.  
&nbsp;  
We will see the cheat-checking program later this semester, as we will have learned enough theory to understand how it works
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Do these count as honor violations?
- Copying somebody's code completely, even if they've taken the course a year ago
- http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/35616/
- A student who, upon taking the class a second time, claimed s/he had already submitted the assignment before (being in the class previously), and thus was allowed to copy the assignment from somebody else
- Taking a 45 minute bathroom break during the final exam to look up the answers
- Looking up the answers on your cell phone during an exam.
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Do these count as honor violations?
The answer to all of these is yes, by the way.  And they have all happened in this course.
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Recent Honor Issues
- In previous semesters we have caught almost 10% of the students in the course cheating
 - And failed them all and raised honor charges
 - If we had time to look harder, we would have likely found more people
- Please don't test us on this

- You will receive <strong class="red">zero credit</strong> for code that does not compile
  - Unless the compiler breaks on Gradescope, there will be absolutely NO exceptions to this rule, so please don't even ask
  - This is an advanced programming class, and under no circumstances should you submit code that does not compile
- The submission system will compile the code when you submit it
  - But that means you have to actually watch the result of your submission (it takes all of 5 seconds)
  - We have a [guide](../docs/compilation.html) as to how to work through compilation errors, and what to do if you can't get it to compile

# Course Goals
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course Goals
1. Levels of abstraction
2. Implementing data structures
3. Time and space complexity analysis
4. Basic program execution model (hw/sw)
5. Assembly language programming
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course Goal 1
Understand program representation from high-level programming language to machine level representation
![Levels of abstraction](images/introduction/levels-of-abstraction.png)
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Course Goal 2
Be able to implement basic and advanced data structures in C++  
&nbsp;

- linked lists
- stacks
- queues
- hash tables
- heaps
- trees
- etc.
	  </script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why do we care about data structures?
- One answer (of many): time
- Consider a program that does the following:
  - Creates 5 list-like data structures
  - Adds 50,000 elements (even integers from 0-100,000)
  - Searches for 25,000 elements (integers from 0-25,000)
  - Deletes 10,000 elements (integers from 0-10,000)
- And records the time each data structure takes for these operations
  - See [DataStructureComparison.java](code/introduction/DataStructureComparison.java.html) ([src](code/introduction/DataStructureComparison.java))
- What are the results?

## The results
From a Pentium 3.0 Ghz PC with enough memory

| Data structure | Running time | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Vector         | 17.311 sec   | Rarely used |
| ArrayList      | 17.281 sec   | Likely most common |
| LinkedList     | 24.255 sec   | Slowest |
| HashSet        | 0.122 sec    | Very fast |
| TreeSet        | 0.119 sec    | Fastest |

<p class="fragment">Difference between a ArrayList & TreeSet: ~150x</p>
<p class="fragment">Difference between a LinkedList & TreeSet: ~200x</p>

## The results, in more detail
All times are in ms (1/1000<sup>th</sup> of a second)  

| Data Structure | Total time | Insert time | Search time | Delete time |
|----------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Vector         | 17,311     | 30          | 12,620      | 4,661       |
| ArrayList      | 17,281     | 28          | 12,609      | 4,644       |
| LinkedList     | 24,255     | 54          | 17,934      | 6,267       |
| HashSet        | 122        | 103         | 9           | 10          |
| TreeSet        | 119        | 93          | 14          | 12          |
| Vector, sorted | 294        | 36          | 19          | 239         |

Note that we sneakily inserted the "Vector, sorted" line

## Feedback from previous semesters
- Some things folks have said in the past about the course:
  - "This has been the most informative / difficult CS course I've taken so far, but definitely worth it"
  - "This course was incredibly challenging, especially for me having not programmed in over a year -- This class changed my entire perspective on computer science, and is giving me an awesome foundation for the rest of my computer science education."
  - "Course was difficult, however I learned a lot."
  - (and a bunch of complaints about the amount of work, blah, blah, blah)
